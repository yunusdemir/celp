The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!\n\nThis particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.\n\nThe seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.\n\nSometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.\n\nI'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.","date": "2011-10-27 13:11:48"}

I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails.","date": "2014-04-19 17:14:38"}

After a few days I decided to call back just to make sure that they weren't waiting on anything else from me and Jeff answered the phone and told me someone would call me back in 5 minutes.

Again I got Jeff and he was extremely rude and said he couldn't take my call right then because other calls were ahead of me (even though I was still waiting for his call back from 5 days previously!). He said he would call back in 15 minutes-no call. Then the manager Cathy called and explained she had been out of town for a week and apologized and said that she would get back to me later in the day. I left two more messaged that afternoon and of course no response. Called again this morning and same response. I would have given up long ago if they didn't have my cc info. I have just e-mailed them to cancel everything and hope that they will actually follow through with this request.\nBottom line is that everyone makes mistakes and I am more than willing to work with someone in that situation but Allyson's Flowers has not made one effort to get to the bottom of this fiasco.

I did exactly that and agreed to the $13 delivery charge. \n\nI get a call about an hour later from a fast-talking scam artist saying they had just moved their location and \"Jeff\" is on his way to the office to figure out what's going on but the driver needs an additional $15 to complete the delivery because the address is farther out than they expected (30 MILES!!!) Uhhhhh NO! How is the location 30 miles away from you when you are listed as local and when I called, there was no mention of an ADDITIONAL delivery fee. I said no way, cancel the order and asked for a refund. I'll give them one business day to give me the refund before I dispute the charge.\n\nThey are obviously not local, just posing as such. DO NOT ORDER from these people. Ugh!", "date": "2017-11-27 20:51:03"}

By dealings with Allyson's Florist absolutely warranted a post on Yelp of a bad review.  My Mom passed away in Seattle, WA.  I live in San Diego, CA and looked up flowers near where my Mom's service would be and Allyson's Florist came up online.  I ordered flowers to be delivered to the Burial site on one day and additional flowers to be delivered to the church on a different date for the Memorial Ceremony.  \n\nThe day of the Burial I received a phone call from the funeral home telling me they hadn't received the flowers for the Burial Ceremony.  I called Allyson's Flowers and they said they didn't have an event to deliver flowers that day but only for the day of the Memorial.  They said they called the funeral home and the funeral home told them there were no events that day.  I of course asked Allyson's Floral why they didn't call the customer (me) to confirm and they just proceeded to blame the funeral home.  The burial and the memorial service date/time/location were both on the funeral's website and the funeral home said all of their employee's have access to the calendar.  So 45 min before the Burial Ceremony I had no flower arrangement for the casket and all Allyson's Florist did for their snafu was say, \"I'm sorry.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry\" does not cut it 45 minutes before the ceremony.  I asked to talk to the manager and they said he (Jeff) was out of town on vacation.  I asked if they could at least waive the delivery fee for this huge snafu and they said they would give me $10.00 off a $600.00 bill, really??  That was all you could do?  \n\nI went to QFC and their florist saved the day.  She made me a beautiful arrangement in less than 30 minutes so I wanted to give a shout out to the local QFC grocery store/florist department for coming through on a very emotional and now flower snafu day.  Thank you QFC!\n\nThe other flowers from Allyson's Floral were delivered to the Memorial on the correct date and location; however, one of the bouquets were wrong.  I called the manager (Jeff) the following week and he told me he was not the manager.  Really?  He said Anna was the manager and she would call me back.  I spoke to Anna and she said she wasn't the manager but the manager did approve the $10.00 discount and she was \"sorry\" for the miscommunication. I gave up at that point to find out who actually is the manager.  Clearly the workers don't know or are hiding this issue from the manager.   \n\nUnbelievable, you do not screw up flowers for weddings and funerals and then have NO customer service and NOT own your mistake and NOT make it right with the customer!!

Discover the Wonders of INNER Space\n\nLike walking through the pages of an exclusive high-end home interiors publication, expect to begin making a list of must-haves soon after arriving.  If you've never visited any of the Arhaus furniture stores, you're missing out on an impressive selection of upholstered and wood pieces, lighting, and many unique accessories.  One beautiful example after another.  At the Crocker Park location, I found at least 10 things I HAD to have. Fortunately, I don't really need them !---but I can't get a gorgeous computer desk/wall unit out of my mind---especially at the substantially reduced sale price. \n\nIt's not inexpensive by most furniture standards, but worth stopping in even if you're closely budgeting right now.  If you like, you can very easily take a look at what's being offered by just pulling up their web site for a stunning preview.   http://www.arhaus.com/   You'll be widening your perspective in a very good way.   After some diligent planning and saving, you might soon be custom-ordering the perfect color in the perfect fabric for that perfect sofa---the very one you fell in love with just a few months before.\n\n***  Watch for advertised store-wide ARHAUS sales.  \n       There may also be unadvertised price reductions on \n       limited items in each store.  Call each location for any \n       special sale-priced pieces.    \n \n***  The least expensive furnishings can sometimes end \n       up being the most expensive over time if you're \n       replacing the same item every few years.   Choosing \n       one of better quality materials and construction is well\n       worth considering.    Arhaus ranges from $$ (sale and \n       some accessories) to $$$$.\n\n***  If contemplating the purchase of any upholstered item \n       from a catalogue or internet source ---whether lower-\n       end or higher-end---you won't be able to test for \n       springs, and seat, back, and arm padding.  Rather \n       than crossing your fingers and hoping it will be \n       comfortable, trying out the real thing is always better \n       and smarter.    \n\n\nIf I sound partial to Arhaus, it's because I worked here (another location) many moons ago.  I found a few of the same beautiful classic favorites, plus lots of new and fabulous additions.    Stop in and see for yourself !", "date": "2012-04-06 05:12:30"}

I asked where he was and he mentioned Westlake...I said \"Washington.\"  He said 'Yes,' I then questioned my order - no order number had been provided (my bad!) and I had 'questimated' the charges based on my order.  Lo and Behold it was more than I thought.  I was told I ordered a higher cost basket and that was why my amount was more.  I gently explained that NO - I was reading right off the website and the one I ordered was not the one that was charge.  Long, long story - I was told by Jeff that my CC would be credited with the additional amount.  So I will wait and see.....if not I will call back.  My aggravation was that he indicated he was in the area I wanted, when in reality they are located in Westlake, OH - 2500\u00b1 from where I wanted the flowers to go.  I incurred the cost of $17.95 for 'delivery' fee.  Lesson for me and everyone - really, really, really look at the name of the place and make sure they are where they say they are.

But the bottle list look to be pretty long so they have a lot of beer options. They also have liquor and I believe they have wine. \n\nI guess what they're known for here would be the pizza. All of their pizza here is thin crust which I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza. I got \"The Breakaway\" which is garlic, mushrooms, and a couple different kinds of cheese. I liked it and it was actually very well-made but it was missing something for me based on my personal preference of pizza I definitely would like to go back and try it again and maybe request some basil on top I think it would add a good bit of extra flavor. They have a lot of different pizzas that I would like to go back and try.

I had been to Aladdin's and Mezza (just a few miles west of The Fountain) before, so I was quite familiar with most of the food. We were the only table there that night for dinner, so service was spot on.  Unfortunately, they don't have a liquor license...boooo.  I ordered a Turkish coffee.  It was pretty strong...similar to espresso.  \n\nWe started off by ordering a bunch of appetizers for everyone to share.  They have a combo deal where you can choose 4 cold appetizers or 3 hot appetizers for $15.  We had hummus, baba ghanoush, Mahamarra, and tabbouleh, all of which came with pita triangles for dipping, falafel, kibbeh, Fatayer pies, and Barak (Obama) Rolls.  I honestly really liked them all!  The Mahamarra had a nice bit of spice to it, but nothing overwhelming.  \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Fountain Mixed Grille - a nice combo plate of Shish Tawook, Chicken Shawarma, beef kabob, and veggies with a side of rice pilaf or bulgur.  It took a little while for the food to come out because they make everything fresh to order, but it was so worth the wait!  This was one big plate of meat!  Everything was juicy, nicely seasoned and cooked just right. (see uploaded photo)  I can't believe I managed to eat it all!  It was so good and I was pretty full so, I didn't have room for dessert.  The owner came out to describe the dessert options available. A number of the girls ordered dessert and they all seemed to like it!  (Check the photos) Maybe next time, I'll order a smaller entree, so I'll have room for dessert. \n\nAfter we were finished, the owner came to thank us for coming in for dinner and the Turkish chef even came out to say hi.  Everyone was very friendly and appreciative of our business.\n\nIt was a great evening of great food and friendly people.  I'll definitely be back!", "date": "2015-04-26 06:38:39"}

My wife had there French onion soup and I had a walleye sandwich. I'm house made chips made even better with being served with French onion dip.", "date": "2017-06-06 03:42:45"}

I really do save those for the BEST of the BEST, in my opinion anyways.  I can't believe no one has reviewed my fantabulous wedding photographer yet, so here you go.\n\nWe hired Making the Moment for our wedding on April 9, 2011.  Our initial meeting was with Brett, the owner.  He answered all our questions and was incredibly friendly & helpful.  We looked through all the photographer's portfolios and decided we liked Vince's style the most.\n\nOur wedding was slightly offbeat...we were married in a theater and had a movie theme, because we are big time movie nerds.  Vince totally embraced this, even staying up late the night before the wedding to watch Pulp Fiction (which he knew was our favorite film and would be referenced many times that day).  I have nothing but positive things to say about our day with him, our own private paparazzi!  He was enthusiastic, artistic, and helpful.  The ceremony music started way before I was ready and I had both my maid of honor and Vince lying on the floor, buckling my shoes for me.  Now THAT is a selfless photographer!  \n\nWe were like kids waiting for Christmas as we waited for our photo preview several weeks later.  It was, of course, worth the wait.  We had a \"premiere night\" with owner Brett at Making the Moment HQ (aka Brett's house).  He set out wine and fancy snacks for us as we viewed our photos.  His excitement about our images matched our own, and we were all pretty giddy as we watched the slide show.\n\nOverall, this is some of the best customer service I've ever received ANYWHERE.  If I can give any brides and/or grooms-to-be advice, it's to splurge on your photos, and hire a photographer that shares your vision.  If you're in Northeast Ohio, hire Making the Moment.  You will not regret it.  I certainly don't hope to get married again any time soon, but I do hope to get the chance to work with them again!", "date": "2012-02-22 02:25:55"}

What used to be a classic French restaurant has modernized into something harder to describe: nouvelle Italian cuisine meets bar food? \n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing. The food was actually very good. The four of us started with three appetizers. The calamari with sundried tomatoes was perfectly cooked, with tender calamari and the tomatoes adding a bright snap to the classic. The duck confit bruschetta was more like shredded duck on toast, but also very tasty, and the Tuna Napoleon was brilliant, with thin slices of tuna on equally thin wontons. Our only regret was that we only got one slice each.\n\nAfter the appetizers, though, the menu gets a bit confusing. The categories to choose from are a limited number of entrees, and then pastas, pizzas, and burgers. See what I mean about the French influence getting lost? Two of our party chose pastas. The Bolognese was pronounced the best ever, but the Chorizo was not a hit. The Filet Mignon was done beautifully. \n\nBeing rather full from the appetizers, I settled on the warm mushroom salad with grilled salmon. Honestly, I think I had the best meal of the evening. The salad was a delicious mixture of sauteed mushrooms and beautiful greens, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. (Note that I asked for the salmon rare and it came on the slightly past medium side, but was still moist. I do find one of the challenges in Cleveland is convincing chefs that fish does not have to be cooked to dry leather.)\n\nThe cocktails we had before dinner were delicious and interesting, and the wine selection is decent. The decor has been toned down to be a bit less French Rustic, but the tables are still decently spaced from each other and the ambiance still romantic. On the whole, I would say that this relaunch is successful. SB Eighty One is a good, if not particularly remarkable, place for a cozy date.", "date": "2011-11-05 16:02:42}

Now the new jack city burger with a meat patty costs $10 dollars on the menu. It features avocado, pepper jack cheese, roasted red peppers, chorizo sausage, and a salsa verde. When I added up the items on my build your own burger with no chorizo sausage and a veggie patty the burger cost damn near $15 dollars. I get that they don't want substitutions but I don't see the big deal in subbing out a veggie patty for a meat one... When asked to speak with manager she said the same thing.

Prior to tonight, I've ordered carryout online after work about every other week.  Tonight, I came to pick up my order and waited at the Curbside Pickup parking spot (like I always have--the 30something times I've done it.)  After about 15 minutes, I finally pulled my car around and went in to get my food.  I was directed to the bar, where there were no employees the first few minutes I was waiting.  Finally, someone came up and provided me my food. When I explained that I had been waiting outside, she informed me that they \"don't do curbside on online orders.\"  Hmm.. well they certainly have every other 30 something times I've ordered this way.  When I explained that, she changed her story and told me they \"only do curbside late at night.\"  Again... I've always ordered right at 5pm when I get off work and they've always brought it out.  Not that I mind going in... but if that's the process, that should always be the process. There's no option to choose curbside vs. inside, etc. when you order online. (BTW.. I also already tipped on my order, assuming it would be delivered curbside.)  \n\nWhen I finally got my food, I left.  Once outside, I realized I wasn't given my coke and returned to get it and had to wait again.  Once I got home, I realized every part of my order was wrong.  I had ordered a burger with a side of french fries.  Then as an additional side, I ordered mashed potatoes for an extra fee.  Didn't get the french fries that came with my meal.  I ordered cheesecake with no strawberries and only chocolate syrup.  What did I get?  You betcha... cheesecake with strawberries and NO chocolate syrup.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous.

Sometimes people want grilled onions), no \"whining\" about how long it takes to sit down, no name-dropping (ok, fair enough, I hated it when people did that), no expecting your burger done any other way than what you tell them (kitchen: absolved and heaven forbid that's well done), but finally, have a great time!\n\nHave we come into a time in the world when restaurants can be so cheeky and in love with themselves that patrons are given a list of commands before even ordering their food?

Some of us have a favorite burger spot and this is mine.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and there doesn't seem to be much turnover at the bar which is where I sit.  There is a solid beer selection and Seasonal draft rotation.  Happy hour draft beer is $3.00 and fries are $1.00.

It was a combo that I never could have dreamed, but one which will haunt my dreams on the best of nights.\n\nAside from the dreamy milkshake, the rest of the place was solid.

I'd definitely recommend the medium-well.  The taste of the burger itself was fantastic, although the bun tended to fall apart and I couldn't really taste the chorizo that was on it.

The burgers were a disaster. Both were way over done. Ordered rare and mid-rare. We were both told how they would arrive per the chart at the restaurant. The rare was medium and the mid-rare was well done. I chose to point this out and the waiter absolutely agreed. I opted to get a new burger made how I ordered. We were pressed for time but assured (and it should've absolutely been no problem) that I could get a new mid-rare. The burger came out, the same over cooked way. I ate 1/4 and left the rest as we had to make the movie.\n\nIf you are a burger joint, you'd better be able to cook a $10 burger properly. I won't be back to this location.

This place does a lot of things right, but it's not fantastic. The first of my quibbles is the high-volume style of the service, which is designed to turn tables and reduce waits, not for a reasonably paced meal. They won't seat you unless your entire party is with you, then they grab empty plates and glasses with an alacrity that suggests guests are inconveniences once they've wolfed down their meals. Don't get me wrong - I understand why they do it, but it sucks. Symon can follow his \"rules\" but I don't have to like them all. The food is pretty good overall. Burgers are solid, but not the best in town as some have claimed. Portions are substantial, particularly on the a la carte sides. The Lola fries are great, though the massive portion of onion rings was a bit heavy on batter and light on crunch. The pulled pork was a bit of a disappointment - it was bland and a bit too wet. The beer selection is more than respectable. The milkshakes are rich and delicious. For me, it adds up to a solid three stars.

You pay 50 cents per fruit topping and 40 cents for dry topping!\n\nI was looking for an \"Original Tart\" flavor which the lady said would be closest to the Creamy Natural. It was pretty much original tart but I think they were trying to go for a different name. My first impression was that it was good. The kiwi was really sweet and I was happy that the flavor tasted like original tart. But towards the end, it wasn't as great. I'm not sure why, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe it was the fact that I had to pay to get my toppings? Seriously, not even 1 topping was included!\n\nPlus the lady working there seemed very preoccupied. When we first walked in, there was no one in the place, not even a worker to greet us. The lady came out of the back room after we were looking at the menu. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't friendly either. She just served us our froyo and then went into the back room again. \n\nOne plus is they have a frequency card (I'm a sucker for loyalty cards!) After you buy 10, you get a free baby with 1 topping (wow they offer 1 free topping!)\n\nAll in all, if this was the only froyo place in town, I'd come.

Not sure of the percentage of fat but is is a perfect combination. The taste is heavenly. Often hidden by the large range of accompaniments the sandwich comes with. The Lola burger has fried egg, applewood bacon and pickled onion (i omit the onion on this one). Do yourself a favor and save a bite with just the meat with maybe a bit of sauce.

I called the front desk to ask if they sold batteries and \"artica\" or whoever answered said she'd call the room back with an answer- which never happened! In a customer service job you do not set an expectation and not follow through. The expectation she set; was a return call to answer my question that never came.

A bit of an odd location (right in the middle of the street at Crocker Park), but that seemed to lend well to the feeling of the place.  With a group of 4, although crowded, we were easily able to rearrange some comfy chairs and tables to accommodate our group.  We all agreed it had somewhat of a comfy ski lodge feel, but looked as if it could convert to a great airy space in the summer, with huge windows that slide open and an attached patio.  We opted to do the wine tasting choice, where you load up a card with $ and then help yourself to different prices of 2 ounce pours of red or white (between $3.75 - $12.50 per pour, deducted from your card).  We also ordered 4 small and large plates to share: spinach & crab dip, chorizo sliders, calamari and pulled pork nachos.  Although everything here is on the pricey side, all of the food was delicious!  These 4 appetizers were the perfect amount of \"dinner\" for the 4 of us to share after binging on popcorn at a movie.  The service was great; everyone there was very friendly, accommodating and aware.  Our server in particular was very good and had a great attitude.  He helped set us up with the wine tasting and checked back just enough that we did not feel bothered but could find him easily if needed.  Overall, it was a great experience; the only downside being the pricing - but I guess that's to be expected at Crocker Park!  I will definitely go back for a cozy evening with friends or a significant other.\n\nUpdate 6/4/12: \nRecently went back with a girl friend for an afternoon glass of wine after a manicure across the street at Anthony Vince. There was a new menu, and the wine tasting machine was no longer available. However, everything was just as delicious as the first time, and Saturday's 12-4pm happy hour was very affordable! The beef sliders came with thin and crunchy onion straws, the tater tots were perfectly seasoned and salty, and the flat bread of the day was some of the best I've had. Furthermore, since we were the only ones in the place, the cute server was very attentive and friendly :-) I highly recommend a relaxing Saturday afternoon spent here enjoying time with friends.", "date": "2011-03-28 17:51:37}

They take credit cards which is nice since I don't carry much cash on me. I decided to go with the Gold $15 to get the salt under my car taken care of, but they do offer a basic wash at $9.

Living on the West Coast I was very hesitant to try and purchase a car from internet pictures and phone calls sight unseen. I contacted the internet sales department and spoke to Tom Zitto. Tom was incredibly helpful. He spend probably hours of his time answering specific questions and sending me detailed pictures of every aspect of the car I was interested in. He understood I was hesitant and nervous to spend so much money on a car I coudn't see in person.\n\n After a week of talking and asking questions I decided to move forward. I was so pleased to find the negotiation process, financing, and even shipment of the vehicle out to California to be easy and painless. I felt I got a fair deal and didnt have to deal with sales tactics and difficulty other dealerships usually give you when they know they have something you want. \n\nOnce my car arrived it was better than I expected! Everything was exactly as Tom had explained and there were no surprises. Tom even took care of the licencing of my car in California all the way from Ohio. \n\nThis was a 5 star experience from start to finish.

The lobster nachos were tasty-- if a bit drenched in the lemon aoili.  There were giant heaps of lobster claw meat nestled (snuggled!) throughout.  The cheese plate was good but a bit silly-- they put the cheese on the crackers for you.

My salmon was cooked very well. His steak was VERY good and the better of the two meals. The lighting was romanticly dim. The food looked beautiful. It's the kind of place where you sit a little taller in your chair because you know you're at a fancy place and you want to make it known that you belong. My only negative was that this feeling was juxtaposed by Katy Perry and Coldplay. We told the owner to consider changing this music choice to old jazz or big band music or even a soft piano.

I think this layout also increases noise in the hallways.  We were awoken on both days by people walking by/talking outside of our room.\n\n- The pool is open in the middle of the hotel, so the whole place sort of smells like chlorine. \n\n- The building itself/the rooms are not that new and seemingly haven't been renovated in a long time.  The bathrooms are cramped and a there was what looked like water damage on the ceiling of our bathroom.\n\n- I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but I didn't get anything special for being an priority club member.  I travel a lot for a work, so I appreciate it when you throw a free bottle of water or snack my way.\n\n- There only shampoo in our room was an almost empty bottle (though the front desk did quickly get me more shampoo).  I also found an old pair of pants someone had left behind the luggage rack in our room.\n\nAll that said there are some good points and reasons you might want to stay here:\n\n- The beds are actually quite comfortable and up to Holiday Inn standards.  \n\n- It is, in fact, very close to Crocker Park, if that's something you're interested in.\n\n- It's right off the interstate and very easy to get to.\n\n- Parking is plentiful and easy.\n\n- There is free interent.\n\nThe two star review reflects these traits and the fact that I value a few things highly that were lacking, but I don't think this is a horrible place to stay.

I have never ate Hormel chili in a can, but I am sure it would have tasted like what we were being served. Skip them! The cheese and scallions were sparse, needless to say we did not eat anymore of them.  The Blue Cow Burger was good, but man, could you put some cheese on it? Jason had the same complaint about his burger...sparse cheese. The onion rings were OK. Ive had better. To sum it all up! The burgers were good and flavorful, but lacked toppings and a bit over priced for there size. Will I go back? I may give them a whirl in the future....

Keep in mind my truck doesn't see much hard work as I special ordered it and it is likely the only new vehicle I'll ever buy.  After I picked up the keys I went out to the parking lot and before I can even get the key in the door I find a hefty dent at EYE LEVEL in my driver door.  I can't fathom they didn't notice this, just hoping I'd drive away before noticing.  My pristine truck had received it's first blemish in the form of an eye level dent.  I went back in side and returned with a manager, to their only benefit they apologized and offered to repair the damage.\n\nOver the next two weeks the body shop worked on the quarter-sized dent by removing the door, dismantling it entirely, re-priming, filled the dent and repainting the door since ordering a painted door isn't a thing.  I was assured that I would not be able to tell it was ever damaged.\n\nAfter a week I stopped by and inspected what they had done and found it looked like crap, every scuff from the body work was very visible. They assured me that it was not done it and still had to be wet sanded.  So I relented and gave them another week to finish the job.\n\nAfter another week the truck was ready.  I looked that patch over with ever bit of scrutiny that I could and could only find the tiny variations between the new paint and the stock paint.  Although I was satisfied I still upset that I took in a new truck and felt like I was leaving with a used, reconditioned truck.\n\nIt's been a year later and what ever wax or polish they used to get me out the door has worn off, which is apparently the last item they had to do that second week.  I can once again clearly see every scuff and scratch from the bondo they slathered on the dent.  Which greets me at eye level every time I open the door.\n\nIn addition, the keypad in the door had not worked since that visit.  Autonation offered to take a look at it but I'd be leaving it there another week, which I was not going to do. I finally just got the keypad fixed at another dealer for $221.95.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this location, especially for body work since they can't even fix their own mistakes.", "date": "2018-06-29 00:26:20}

Walking into B-Spot with that in mind was a problem.  To give you the background of our experience, we arrived about 1pm on a Sunday.  I got the chicken sandwich and my fiance got the grilled cheese.  We split them both. I got the vanilla apple pie bacon milkshake and he got a bourbon drink.  We also go the house made chips with rosemary dip to split.  \n\nOur first impression was sloppy looking staff, and no waiting area. You have to hover on top of everyone who is trying to come in.   There is a very young host staff, but the servers seemed to know what they were doing. The entire place was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for two.  There were a few 4 people tables available, with a sign at every table that clearly states that no reservations were allowed. My only conclusion is that the staff is not allowed to sit 2 people at a table for 4.  That's great for the restaurants pocket book, but bad for customer service. \n\nThe food was sub-par and overpriced.  Nothing tastes or looks, made from scratch.  It all tastes very premade. At $9 for a grilled cheese, I expected a lot more. I didn't care for either sandwich.  The chicken was dry and the peppers on the grilled cheese were very bitter. The chips were ok, but the sauce was thick and congealed looking. \n\nThe only thing I really liked was the milkshake.  Those flavors really do go good together!  Perhaps if we had gotten a burger we would have liked it more, however, then everything else on the menu should be cheaper.  Because nothing else is very good. \n\nOverall I think that this is a great example of a good idea gone mainstream.  Everything was \"how do we lower the cost as much as possible but still make money from the clients.\"  There was obviously no other motivation in this restaurant.", "date": "2012-07-07 18:54:09}

I use a app called iexit down loaded for free . It tells us what is at the exits ahead of our drive . Every time we see a Holiday Inn Express I call direct and always get the nicest folks , booked on the spot normally when were an hour down the road. Ask for the veteran discount saves me a few bucks. \nAny ways the guy who checked us in was extremely friendly , the room is huge and i live the soft comfortable bedding,  large screen TV , frig. And Microwave really helps.\nWill stay here again if we come back this way", "date": "2016-09-25 01:23:01}

While the $1 fries are still offered, paying $10 for 6 sliders seemed a bit ridiculous...among other things. \n\nThe more time that slowly crept by after being seated, as well as my disappointing discovery of a newer/shittier happy hour, and the looming dread of paying ALOT more than I was anticipating with a party of 3, we were just about to walk out. \n\nOh wait, there's our server, fine, I guess we will stay and hope it's at least worth it. Server seemed nice I guess, table ordered 2 build your owns, 3 fries, a porky burger and PBR for me - of which I received BOTH the can and an empty glass. I'm fine with just a can, server could have asked a preference at least. \n\nThe wait time was fine in terms of receiving our order. But not short enough to distract me from noticing a number of fruit flies buzzing around our table and in our faces. One of them actually found its way down into my dumb glass of PBR, needless to say I was done drinking after finding it. What the fuck?!\n\nBurgers were cooked decently. Mine came without the BBQ sauce it was supposed to come with - so the tableside coffee BBQ had to do. Fries were great, but all of our burgers just made the bottom bun a soggy, unappealing mess. \n\nShould have just walked out and gone somewhere else. $50 really didn't sit well with me with this experience.

He's a big Mexican food fan and I'm a little more lukewarm about it.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas for my meal and had some mixed feelings.  First, the enchilada is very very basic, with just chicken inside of a tortilla and a cheese sauce on top.  On my plate, I was also served a mexican rice and black beans.  For someone who isn't super gung-ho on Mexican food and who also doesn't have much of a tolerance to spice, this inauthentic \"Americanized\" interpretation worked for me.  The majority of the flavor came from the rice, which tasted like it was cooked in a salsa verde sauce and had a zesty flavor.  The cheese sauce on top was a little liquidy, but the tortilla was the worst part.  It felt doughy and undercooked.  That being said, the simple ingredients were okay with me.  If the tortilla had been appropriately cooked and the sauce was a thicker consistency, I wouldn't have had anything negative to say.\n\nAs far as atmosphere, the restaurant is huge.  It is very modern and doesn't really seem like a Mexican restaurant, but I couldn't really put my finger on what it actually felt like.

All of us are from several states away.  Since we are not familiar with Cleveland restaurants, we were literally taking a chance on Cabin Club.  Wow, am I glad we did.\n\nOur experience here was perfection.  My BF's father waited for us at the bar.  He said that he could tell that most of the people there were locals.  It was Friday night, and the place was packed but not overly-so.  The atmosphere is energetic yet still comforting.\n\nWe were immediately seated at a nice corner booth where we would be able to talk to each other.  From the get-go until we were done, our waitress, JoAnn (I hope that is right) was outstanding.  What a pro!  She was both patient and sharp.  She was helpful and unassuming with the wine list.  She didn't flinch and was extremely informative when my picky BF ordered his meal and asked about every single aspect of what was served with it.  She insisted he get the salad dressing on the side and then followed up later to make sure he liked it.  She also didn't flinch when my BF's father made a meal out of three appetizers.  The way they served it was beautiful, too.  Finally, we hogged her booth almost all evening, and not for a moment did I get the impression she was trying to rush us or get rid of us.  She and the rest of the staff visibly work hard and do a great job at making everyone feel at home.\n\nBut just as much as the service, we would come back for the amazing food.  Where to start?  My (remember, picky) BF had \"the best pork chop of his life\".  Seriously, it did look huge and juicy; bone in with rice and green beans.  I had shrimp and scallops over lobster mashed.  Whoever invented this dish must be an angel, but the way it was cooked and put together is what made it amazing.  The shrimp were deliciously grilled; the scallops perfect in texture, and the mashed flavorful and not overly greasy/buttery like some places.  Unfortunately, I could not finish it after all of the french onion soup and bread I'd had. :( !  All of the food was really, really, really great and definitely unlike any food we get anywhere else.  (Side note: I live in Phoenix/Scottsdale, and there are a lot of amazing restaurants, but still no food even close to what Cabin Club's is like).  \n\nFinally, I am NOT a dessert person at all, but we ordered a peach cobbler.  The men scooped it down, and I had a bite or two.  Let's just say that there is no disappointment in this dessert.  Not too sugary-sweet, cooked with fresh peaches, and topped with quality ice cream.  It was just plain tasty.\n\nThe feel of the cabin, the \"old\" bathrooms, and the \"slight imperfections\" of the buildling, to me, are what makes this place so comfortable.  Except for the freezing cold air conditioning, I felt very much at home here.  Next time we are in Cleveland, I can guarantee we'll be making reservations here again.  We had a truly special evening here with uniquely amazing food.", "date": "2013-10-18 16:30:42}

I brought my wedding rings in to be buffed and cleaned (I work with my hands a lot so they take a beating more often than not). Upon entering a gentleman came up to me, asked me if I needed help, and when I told him that I'd like my rings cleaned and the scratches buffed a little he informed me that they \"don't buff scratches off because it wears away at the gold.\" He didn't offer to clean them or assist me with anything else, either. \n\nLater when I was back in St. Louis I went to my normal, trustworthy, talented and experienced jeweler who actually custom made my rings. I told her what had happened and she told me she had never heard of such a thing and that buffing doesn't \"wear down the gold\" but that over-buffing the ring would maybe make it more malleable as it heats up. But she told me that even this would require massive amounts of buffing over years and years with nonstop wear-and-tear on the rings. \n\nI also noticed that the pieces they have there are quite expensive. In particular the Swarovski jewelry that they carry in stock is marked up over 50% (I checked online). I bought a Swarovski piece as a present for my aunt and they didn't even take the price tag off but instead they WRAPPED it with the price tag still showing! They forgot to take the price tag off the bracelet itself AND the box they wrapped it in! That was so embarrassing! Of course it was the first thing she saw when she opened it up!

We called ahead by a day to make sure that we would be able to come with him, and were assured that it would not be a problem. Upon reaching, we requested a corner patio table to make sure we would be out of other patrons ways if they had any issues - this is where the problems started. \nThe hostess was taken aback with the fact that we had a dog with us, and became very brusque. Upon informing her we had called in and asked she hurriedly sat us down. Within a minute we had a manager come on out, and aggressively proceed to inform us that dogs were not allowed at that place, and we better stay in that table and not go anywhere else so that other people did not complain. Classy. \nThroughout the meal we experienced snide remarks and digs at that, implying the fact that we should not be there. \nIf you don't allow pets - make it clear and I well get food somewhere else. Or let me sit and treat me like any other customer. Unacceptable.\n\nAll this could be better if the food and drinks were the saving grace. Unfortunately, they were not. \nWe ordered the Arancini as appetizers. The overall taste was decent, but was marred by the fact that by the time they got the dish to our table, it was already somewhat cool and soggy, and by the time we were able to get the waiter's attention for cutlery, it was worse.\nFor the main course we ordered stuffed trout (saltless, bought out fairly cold and the sooner forgotten the better) and the pasta bolognese (covered in a layer of shallots with meat that tasted like it came out of a hamburger helper box). \nEeks. \n\nThe food itself would make the rating a 2-star.

I thought it would be nice to take her there for an early Valentine's day dinner, since we were both so impressed when we went 2 years ago. I called and made reservations 3 weeks in advance and only had the option of 4pm or 9pm or later. Note to all: MAKE A RESERVATION, especially on the weekend. We opted for the early dinner and went at 4pm last Saturday.\n \nWe were one of the first groups to arrive, since they open at 4pm and were seated at a small 2 person table, a tad disappointing since there were some booths available but we aren't too picky. The restaurant is enclosed in a cozy log cabin and has a small area of tables on one half (hence the reservation recommendation) and another side with a nice bar and a couple of TV's lined up as well. Our server was Genevieve for the evening. She was very personable and went over the Valentine's day specials.\n \nWe started with the \"special\" appetizer of the night, the mussels. Melissa is obsessed with mussels and they aren't particularly one of my favorites but these were divine. 15 mussels, one in every shell in a white wine garlic sauce was a fantastic start. Melissa had the apple salad next and I went with the customer favorite, the lobster bisque. People this bisque is no joke, I honestly would have been happy just getting another bowl of this for my meal it was that good. Even the drinks were fantastic, I went with the Shanghai Moscow Mule (with a tint of apple, simply perfect) and Melissa had a small cocktail and glass of Moscato that she very much enjoyed.\n \nOur main entr\u00e9e was the Steak Christopher, which is twin medallion filets over mashed potatoes with b\u00e9arnaise, asparagus between 2 prawns of shrimp. Have to say, my steak was not cooked to how I asked but it didn't matter as it was perfect. The b\u00e9arnaise sauce and mashed potatoes go amazingly with the cut of meat. My only gripe was that the shrimp weren't all that great but I guess not everything can be perfect.\n \nI have to say that this is a top notch steak joint on the Cleveland west side. We had great service, food that was priced correctly for the serving size, and a wonderful ambiance in the restaurant itself.

I think it's an enormous rip off, and I do not shop here for my usual grocery hauls. However, this Giant Eagle is right by my house, so whenever I need to run to the store for a random item or two (usually 2-4x per month), this is where I go. \n\nThis Giant Eagle is very clean, well stocked, and has a very good selection. Their bakery, sushi, already prepared foods (like rotisserie chickens), salad bar, and wine selection are really nice. They also offer a lot of items that I have a hard time finding at other stores (a certain yogurt, bread, etc.) \n\nThe employees at this location are split about 50/50. Half are nice and/or competent, and the other half are either rude and/or don't know what they are doing. For example, I was in there one day in the 12 items or less line, and this lady was trying to buy individual clementines. The cashier said they didn't sell individual clementines and wondered where she got them. Two other employees were also there (one was checking out, and another was from the self checkout area), and no one knew where these clementines were from. So theyre just holding up the already long line trying to figure it out when I informed them that they're the free ones that are for kids while parents are shopping. I hardly even come here and I knew that, lol. Really? Three employees had no clue? \n\nAnother time I called to place a cake order, and apparently it was a real inconvenience to the bakery lady who was super rude evvvery step of the process. But whatever, the white cake with the satin (whipped) frosting from GE is so delicious that I'm willing to put up with rude employees to get it. \n\nBut, I'll still give this location 4 stars because it's not a bad store, it's clean, and they're always stocked. The prices are a rip off, and they could use more cashiers, especially during busy times- but what grocery store doesn't have that problem.

Cleveland isn't necessarily known for its cuisine, but thanks to Iron Chef Michael Symon, that might be taking a turn for the better. If traveling on a budget and the idea of eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant worries your wallet, never fear. Chef Symon has the perfect place for you - B-Spot Burgers. With multiple locations, we ended up at the one located in a upscale mall plaza. (For you Chicagoans, very similar to Bolingbrook's Promenade). \n\nB-spot Burgers is known for just that, great burgers. Skip the line though and just hit up the bar. Quicker service and better ambience. The feel of the restaurant is very modern meets garage sale. A large B is outlined on the wall made entirely of beer cans, fake antler chandeliers hang above the tables of dark wood, and the house is bustling. Reasonable prices and if you get there in time for Happy Hour, you'll be even happier with the price. \n\nMichael Symon has multiple restaurants throughout Cleveland including more upscale ones such as Lolita and Lola. To try to get a feel for these, I opted for the Lola Burger. Burger with fried egg, bacon, pickled red onions, cheddar and mayo with a side of Lola fries. No big frills, just a good burger. They give you a nice option of 6 sauces to choose from on the table which I find interesting and fun. I enjoyed having said I've been to one of Chef Symon's restaurants but it's nothing too out of the ordinary. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely eat there again and did enjoy it, but it's not \"get in the car, we're driving 6 hours back to Cleveland\" kind of place.  \n\nIf you want the novelty of eating there, I suggest you go.

I get constant auto emails asking me to come back. So far out of the realm of possibility. The staff is RUDE, even scanning your pass is annoying for them. If you're lucky enough to get your kids in there for childcare hours, they act like you are inconveniencing them. Once, the childcare staff actually told me they were closing an hour early so I had to come get the kids an hour before they were listed as closing. Asked the manager, he said there was no plan to close, he had no idea they were doing that. The kids bathroom was flooded every time we used childcare, the kids come out with SOAKED socks. The dropping of the weights and loud groaning are intolerable. Machines would stay broken for weeks and weeks, and the entice-you-to-join Tvs on the cardio equipment were rarely functional. If they still have the big runway-esque carpet spread out across a big, inconvenient space right smack in the middle of the gym, you'll love the awkwardness of trying to get to the line of sweaty people waiting to use the water fountain, walking around people squatting and lunging down the runway. Because oh hey, forgot to mention, asked if they had water to purchase and they told me to go to Trader Joes. Went to a few Zumba classes, which reminded me of the elementary school playground...better be in the inner-circle group of die hard Zumba-ers, or you'll be shoved in the back where you can't see--until the instructor comes around giving high fives to all her friends. At least you can see SOMETHING I guess. Lovely to walk in the room right after a class ended to smell sweat and see puddles of it on the floor from the last class. That was special, for sure. Oh and one last tip, if you are in a hurry, don't ask to change your membership, add childcare or add a family member--nothing that takes actual customer service. If your experience is anything like mine, you might have to sit and wait until 4 guys stand in a group and chat about their workouts the night before. Literally happened while sitting in their office in front of the computer...clearly, comparing their muscles is way more important than helping customers. \n\nOther than those few very minor things...great place to spend time! ;-)", "date": "2016-02-05 23:48:11}

I ordered the Red Hot Burger asked for it medium figuring it would come out the same as when your order in S-ville.  But it came out with almost no pinkness.  Actually close to medium well done.  That's okay, I still enjoyed it.  It has a lil spice, but it's not really that hot.  Okay, nod to S-ville on the burgers.  Had the onion rings and fries which we shared.  Onions rings at Crocker were much, much better than S-ville.  S-ville's tend to be greasier and heavier.  Definite nod to Crocker on the rings. (Make's me wonder if S-ville is reusing their oil.  Was 2nd customer in S-ville this past Sunday and rings were greasy.)   Service was excellent, they popped a high chair in for my nephew lickedy split.   Despite all the hype on the fries, they are just okay.  I mean I ate them and all, but meh!  Fries at BBE are much, much better.  Service was fabulous and pickle bar is great.  Like Crocker B Spot better than S-ville because S-ville always has the music cranked too high.  I mean who wants to be blasted at 11:05 am on Sunday morning.  Last note, my friend had the \"Chick Magnet\"  chicken thingie at S-ville.  Said he would not order t again (really wonder about their oil).  But hey, it's a burger joint.  Oh, for those of you who call Crocker Park a strip mall, give it up.  Strip malls don't have parking garages.  Just because it is out doors and has an old 'main street' look ... well that doesn't make it a strip mall.  hahahaha do I detect Crocker Park envy?\n\nDowngrading my rating after last two visits there.  Last one was Nov 12th (11/12/12)  The burgers are still top notch.  But the fries came limp and less than hot.  The porky fries were a mess.  We left most of the fries.

If a couple of owners have called to report, I'M PRETTY SURE A DOG THERE MUST HAVE BEEN COUGHING A LITTLE TO DETECT IT.

No matter, though, I was too busy chowing down my chocolate shake and cheeseburger. Bonus points for the pickle bar! \n\nThe food is solid, nicely prepared and in moderately sized portions. Don't expect a mammoth burger, but these patties are flavorful and fairly sized. Sides are extra, so if you're in the sharing mode, try the onion rings - they are spectacular.

If it had been a snack on a party platter, I would've finished the whole platter by myself! The raw tuna tasted very fresh with the scallions and the eel sauce gave it sweetness that went great with the crispiness of the chip. \n\n2. Butternut squash bisque with granny smith apple paired with a chardonnay.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night. It was sweet with a slight nutmeg taste to it and it just tasted delicious. I enjoyed every bite of savory goodness.\n\n3. Porchetta and potatoes with gorgonzola cheese paired with a combo red.\n\nThe fatty meat with the crispy skin was delicious, although more toward the center, the meat was dry. The potatoes were also awesome especially with the melt in your mouth cheese.\n\n4. Stuffed shells with a meat sauce and spinach paired with a cabernet savignon.\n\nThis is was probably my least favorite dish of the night but it was still tasty. The red meat sauce had some spiciness to it that made it all the better, but compared to the other dishes, I felt it needed work.\n\n5. Chocolate tart with black pepper (Yes! black pepper!) ice cream paired with a port.\n\nThis dessert was something different and in a good way. The chocolate tart had a dark chocolate cream/ganache on top with a crunchy chocolate cookie on the bottom. The black pepper ice cream was pretty much regular vanilla with pepper/salt sprinked over it which actually went over quite well.\n\nAll of this came for $35 a person! I know this isn't the normal menu, but I asked the server if this chef was the regular and he told me it was, so if that is the case, I would DEFINITELY come back to try what else he has to offer.

Nothing like a dinner at one of the points of the famous \"Viagra triangle\" to make you feel older than you already are, right?  Anyways, we kept the reservation and I got all dolled up in my best cardigan set and orthopedic shoes (jokes...I've got jokes) and we actually had a very nice night!  Saucy Bistro has a very nice wine menu and the majority of the bottles are very reasonably priced.  I picked a Sangiovese/Syrah blend that was just wonderful.  We started with the calamari that was good, but not served with any type of sauce.  The batter had a nice lemon-garlic flavor and there was sundried tomatoes tossed with the calamari, but a nice aioli would have made the dish better.  For our second course we both chose the Bittaker salad.  This was one of the best salads I have had in a long time.  The vinaigrette dressing was amazing and mixed perfectly with the salty crunch of the bacon.  And the bleu cheese tossed into the salad was the creamiest and most delicious I have ever had.  I meant to ask our server who supplies the restaurant with their cheeses, but my food coma kicked in by the end of the meal and I forgot.  Damn.  For the third course I had the filet and my fiance had the prime rib.  We were both very pleased with our entrees.  My filet was cooked to a perfect medium and the crab with bearnaise sauce was the perfect addition.  We topped off our meals with the pistachio bread pudding which was a-maz-ing.  The service was very good, we felt attended to but not bothered by constant interruptions.  The one negative about our meal was the noise coming from the open kitchen.  I understand that restaurant kitchens aren't quite places, but I just seemed that the dropped a whole heck of a lot of pots and pans that night.  More than once during our meal I jumped because I was startled by a very loud bang coming from the kitchen.  If we go back I would request a table on the patio or more towards the back of the restaurant to have a more pleasant dining atmosphere.  Other than that, Saucy Bistro is a win in my book!

I had purchased from Brian's in a previous \"life,\" so I decided to take my girlfriend there with me to look. \n\nBrian's didn't disappoint. They offer high quality furniture in high quality fabrics. Nearly all pieces of furniture can be upholstered in the fabric of your choosing, and they have a HUGE selection of fabrics to choose from. They also have wood furniture, dining sets, bedroom sets, cabinets... \n\nYou will not be hounded when you walk in the door. A salesperson may say \"hello,\" but they are not inclined to follow you around. You're free to just look around. If you see something you like, ask and they'll be happy to tell you all about the item(s) you're interested in. Low pressure sales at its finest. And once you do decide to pull the proverbial trigger you'll be shocked at how reasonable the price really is given the overall quality of the furniture, and fabric offerings available. \n\nWe purchased a sofa, two chairs and a sofa table. I will also be returning to price a custom entertainment center. That's right, custom. Brian's will build your furniture!!! It's incredible! \n\nIf you're looking for cheap discount furniture, Brian's may not the place for you (I'd recommend Value City Furniture or Levin if that's where you are budget-wise). But if you're looking for some of the best quality furniture you can find this side of Amish Country, then go check out Brian's; family-owned and operated since 1986. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.", "date": "2017-09-29 18:19:23}

I'm a fan - but I always leave wishing it would have been a little bit better.

Yum.\n\nMy favorite thing about B-Spot? The fact that their menu literally has an asterisk at the bottom (at least the online version does) that says \"We cook in lard.\" Oh, boy.\n\nThe Lola fries have a touch of Rosemary and are nicely salted. The Lola Ketchup on the other hand, I found to be somewhat yucky. The ShaSha sauce - some kind of hot-peppery goodness, is delish - I am a fan.\n\nI will admit I miss Agave & the interior of this place, albeit now filled with empty beer cans configured in B on the wall, an antler chandelier, and ridiculously light-weight metal looking chairs - still kinda reminds me of the old place. Okay, it's probably because the bar is still in the same place and we all know that's where I spent a lot of time... but still. The patio is also still there so it's perfect for people watching (or creeping) while enjoying a delicious burger or brat.\n\nI know some people are turned off by the laminated note on the table that lays out the rules for you - pretty much it says look, your food all comes out together, we'll make your food how we want (except we can take off whatever you're allergic to), don't try to add anything, and if you're offended that we're so blunt, you're uptight. So there. But, eh - nobody there has every really copped an attitude (at least with me). So, I think it's just part of the grungy, trendy, ski lodge, auto repair shop chic they have going on.\n\nThe vanilla, apple pie, bacon milkshake is delicious and filling, or so I'm told - but really how could you not love something that has BACON in it?? One item that does creep me out? The bologna sandwiches - it's literally like an inch thick piece of meat - heart attack city! But I'm sure it's delish. I've also had the chips which come with yummy Parmesan fondue cheese (also with a hint of rosemary, which I'm now assuming must be a fave of the Iron Chef).

The inside is classy yet comfortable, and even when every table is full, the noise-level remains moderate enough to enjoy conversation with your companions.  Based on atmosphere alone, 87 West is worth visiting.  However, I found the wine selection to be lacking.  When I go to a wine bar, I expect to be nearly overwhelmed by the number of choices.  Here, I was rather underwhelmed.  In my search for a sweet white wine, I was left empty-handed.  I asked our waitress for her opinion, and agreed to her selection, only to find that my wine was not sweet at all.  I wasted $7 on a tiny glass of wine I didn't even enjoy.  My boyfriend fared better in his search for a spicy red wine, but was none too pleased that it was $9 for the two-ounce pour.\n\nI found the martini selection to be more appealing, but sadly overpriced at nearly $10 each.  At that price point, I'd much rather go to the VTR for a martini of superior quality.\n\nThey did have three martini specials at $5 each, but when I attempted to order one, the waitress informed me they were all out.

I also believe there are positives here, but due to our recent (and in our opinion rather severe) issues we will not be returning.\n\nFirst, what I see as positives: When things are going well, meaning you are a consistent paying customer, the staff is great in providing quick in-and-out service and know your pets well. The usual staff we have had experience with were always great to work with and would provide a general overview of how are dog did during his stay. Generally dropping off or picking up my dog only took a minute or two.\n\nThe other positive (which is a good transition into the negative) is that if an incident occurs (e.g. your dog is sick, injured, etc) the 'usual' staff will contact you to inform you of the issue. The one time this happened for us, the staff notified us that our dog had been isolated and left us the option to pick him up early or wait until the end of the day.\n\nNow for the negatives: We understand that in a facility with many dogs intermingled there are bound to be incidents. These can be anything from a sick dog to a scared dog to an injury from rough play. In our one phonecall, our dog yipped during play and subsequently was attacked by a couple other dogs. Due to being scared, he was segregated so he could calm down. There isn't much any doggy daycare organization can do to minimize this when playtime is involved.\n\nSomething organizations can affect however is to ensure that when it is presented that dogs will be supervised at all times, that they are in fact supervised. Throughout the day, when I check the camera, there will be no staff members with the dogs. I believe this leads to some incidents being more severe because staff cannot respond quickly.\n\nThe last negative I see lies in the transition of staff within the facility. Earlier I referenced the usual staff. These are the individuals who were at the facility during our first use of this organization. They very quickly recognize and know the behaviors of each dog. Most recently, we have encountered a new set of staff who do not necessarily know the dogs or the owners. Combined with the previous negatives, I think this has contributed to our decision to not return to the facility.\n\nFInally, the rest of this is a description of why we will not return. This past week I did not see my dog on camera for most of the afternoon. When I arrived to pick him up I was informed he had a scratch on his face. When he came to the front with staff, his right leg was covered in blood. The staff cleaned him up with wet wipes and said it must have been a growth that ruptured.\n\nWhen we got home, my wife and I cleaned his leg and found puncture wounds. Within a few hours, those wounds were filling with fluid, continued to bleed due to the depth of the wounds, and it came to a point where our dog couldn't walk on his right front leg. We decided this was too much damage to consider the facility safe for our pet and my wife called to request a refund of the un-used portion of our visit package.\n\nWe were told we must come in with the debit card used to purchase those visits. The next day my wife went in and rather than refund the money, the staff at the desk charged us the amount to be refunded. Due to the way refunds work, we are now waiting on about $260 ($130 X 2) to be refunded because debit card refunds allow Banks up to 10 days to process the refund.\n\nWhile onsite, my wife was told that our dog was one of the aggressors in an incident that caused his bites. My wife asked to see the video because we were concerned about any aggression he might show. At that request, we were informed that they cannot share the video of the incident with us. My wife requested to speak to the owner who we were told is out of town. As an add-on, this incident and all conversations have happened with the newer staff.\n\nAs a final activity, we took our dog to the vet because of the swelling in his leg. The vet had to lance and drain the wound and he is now on medication for both the pain and infection. The vet also stated that the bite marks are indicative of a dog in a submissive position on their back. Thankfully our vet took photos for documentation. However in addition to the refund funds pending, we also are down an additional $300 for the vet visit because of the incident. It is my opinion that this could have been prevented with better training of staff and appropriate oversight of the dogs within the facility.", "date": "2018-04-26 15:52:28}

The sides were tasty and the cornbread side was just awesome. Unfortunately due to the mediocre service, I have to give Cabin Club a three. Our server was slow and could not get her timing right. We had a very long wait between getting drinks and our order being taken followed by another long wait before salads and soups were brought to the table. Our table of four had 2 soups and two salads. First one soup appeared. Minutes later the salads and a few minutes after that the final soup (the lobster bisque is outstanding!) It would have been better had all the soups and salads appeared together. Our steaks did show up together, however once done, there was another long wait for a dessert menu, more time spent waiting for her to take dessert orders, etc. To be fair, our server was friendly, just seemed disorganized. The atmosphere was more bar than steakhouse. That's not a complaint, just a statement. The food was good enough that we'll be back.

On the plus side, it is larger than many of the other Giant Eagles and, since it has more space, offers a better selection of many items than you get at the smaller stores.  It also carries more of certain items like prepared foods, sushi, wine, candy by the pound, and bakery than the Giant Eagles closer to Cleveland - I'm guessing this is due to its location in a more affluent suburb where people are more likely to spend on these products.  It also has more floor space devoted to seasonal items such as local sports memorabilia and (at Christmas time) Christmas ornaments, so I have found some interesting things to buy other than food here. \n\nOn the minus side, the store layout is not very user-friendly.  Upon entering the store you have to navigate the large bakery, prepared food, wine and seasonal sections before you even get to the food.  I realize this is to encourage you to spend on these items but if you go in specifically to get a can of beans or a package of meat, it's a pain having to walk about a half mile just to get to standard food items.  The food aisles also don't go all the way through the store front to back.  Instead the aisle is divided in half by another aisle and different products are placed on the two halves of the aisle.  This has made it very hard for me to find things several times.   The store also seems to have way too much useless junk for sale, such as cheap children's toys and books.  Finally, this store always seems to have uniformed security guards hanging around prominently, making me wonder what is going on at this location to make that necessary, as I go to several Giant Eagles located closer to Cleveland and do not see this kind of \"security presence\" at any of them unless the police have been specifically called to deal with some incident.

This time at the Crocker Park location.  One that I suggested was long overdue after Symon's disappointing attempt with Bar Symon in Avon Lake (that I'll blame on his poor partnering with investors hell bent on reviving their failed shopping plaza).\n\nThis restaurant is conveniently located next to Champp's near the bookstore and movie theater, with surface lots not far from the entrance.  Next door there's a frozen yogurt store, giving a great dessert option.\n\nThe restaurant decor is inspired by the other B Spot locations featuring lots of stainless steel, and as Kramer says, \"wood is good.\"  It's not bad for a burger bar.\n\nOur server was pleasant, but boy their little PDA order-taking-doohickies don't bode well for simple requests or changes.  I'm told there's a rule there, \"Symon Says,\" which quite honestly is rubbish.  Lawfully there can't be an absolute \"Symon Says,\" if he expects to operate a business in Ohio as he and his staff still needs to take into account substitutions and subtractions for food allergies...so Symon can s*ck it.\n\nFirst the drink orders.  Asked for a Coke, received an over sugared Pepsi...no harm, I shouldn't be drinking that cr*p anyways--but still a pet peeve to any Coke fan that cares.\n\nServer takes our orders.  I ask for a cheeseburger, no lettuce, no tomato, no onion.  Server is just about to walk away, and goes, \"oh wait, I forgot the specials.\"  \"It's a burger, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and special sauce with potato chips.\"  Ok, just add potato chips to my burger.....[[hesitation]] \"Uhh, I can't do that.\"  Ok, may I please have the burger special, but no lettuce, no tomato, and no special sauce.  \"Sure, I think I can do that...lemme check.\"  \n\nYou know what Symon is really saying right now?--I just duped CLE with a cheap knock-off of a Bobby Flay Crunchified Burger (http://www.bobbysburgerpalace.com/files/image_gallery/15e976c7d5c4330fbdd1f53e56f1488a_full_size.jpg)\n\nThe burger arrived, it looked good, but the chips that Symon uses suck.  They're awful...they tasted stale.  Moral of the story is...don't order a knock-off Crunchified burger and expect the best.\n\nBill comes...$48 for three at the restaurant that was purported prior to it's opening to offer Clevelander's \"a place to stop in, grab a burger and a beer for $10.\"  Symon had a fantastic dream, a wonderful idea, but horrible execution.\n\nThe burgers--unoriginal stale knock offs of other chefs.  \nThe pickle bar--disgusting, a public health violation.\nThe drinks--don't expect what you order.\n\nMe thinks not, and me thinks I'm not going to be returning.", "date": "2012-03-28 18:42:54}

When I arrived, I was told that while our reservation was for 7:30, they wouldn't be open for seating downstairs til 8:00. When we closed out our tab in the bar, first, we were told by the manager that we couldn't eat downstairs, then when it was pointed out that we made quite clear our desires and that it should have been brought up over the phone when I made the reservation, or at arrival, the story became that we couldn't have the kids downstairs because it was a nightclub, and against state liquor laws.\n\nI suppose I shouldn't be surprised if the manager wasn't familiar with state liquor laws, as he also told us that by allowing the kids to try a sip of our cocktails, the restaurant could get in trouble. After being reminded of that comment by a fellow Yelper, I went looking for information, and this is actually addressed in ORC (Ohio Revised Code) 4301.69(B), which says, \"No person who is the owner or occupant of any public or private place shall knowingly allow any underage person to remain in or on the place while possessing or consuming beer or intoxicating liquor, unless the intoxicating liquor or beer is given to the person possessing or consuming it by that person's parent, spouse who is not an underage person, or legal guardian and the parent, spouse who is not an underage person, or legal guardian is present at the time of the person's possession or consumption of the beer or intoxicating liquor.\" It seems pretty clear the state of Ohio is okay with parents letting their own kids try a sip of their libations.\n\nThere was no apology, no offer to make it right, no alternative presented. We spent over a half hour in the bar waiting for a table they appeared to have no intention of ever making good on. The only thing he did right was immediately and without question refund the unconsumed cocktail that had been intended to come downstairs with us. \n\nThe astonishingly poor service made the appetizers we ate look almost passable. $12 for seven shrimp in a shrimp cocktail? The calamari was okay, but a bit undercooked for my tastes.

Except much,  much more painful. This was not my first waxing experience by any means but it was the most pain inflicting experience ive ever had. The girl doing my wax seemed very inexperienced and did nothing to ease the pain (like pull the skin taut or apply pressure) . The application was super messy and she pulled the wax off slowly, ouch! There were many hairs left over that she said were too short (they were not). I hurried out of there since i did not want her touching me anymore. When i came home i found i had areas that were simply not touched and lots of wax still stuck to me.  You should not have to shower and shave after a wax! Bottom line: their waxes are a bargian but you will pay for it in many other ways. Do yourself a favor and go to a real salon.", "date": "2015-04-14 16:40:06}

It was basically a rice ball with cheese in the middle fried with pasta red sauce on top. \n\nSecond course, salads. We were able to pick off the menu. We both chose the arugula salad. Again, not bad, nothing super special though. The goat cheese on it was the best part. About this time, the waitress brought us some bread with butter with maybe with a hint of Italian seasoning in it. Bread was good.\n\nThen we got our entrees and the whole dinner went downhill. I got the sirloin. He got the pepper strip steak. Pepper strip steak was  better than the sirloin, but not good. It was overlooked and the whole plate was covered in butter from the carrots that came with it. My sirloin was terrible.  Rubbery, overlooked, no seasoning. Not too much else to say about that.

I noticed the the receipt when I got home and gave Tina a call. Turns out, I was up-charged $15 for gel nails.  I did not want gel nails. My technician spoke little English and handed me sample colors in a basket to select from. I asked to go look at the back wall (where I later learned housed the regular polish) so that I could see all the colors easily. He said \"no, pick from the basket\". I ended up unknowingly selecting a gel color. Was I told this? No. He just carried on and did my nails. When I called Tina, she said that since the color is already on my nails, there's nothing we can do. \"It's like asking for a refund on a meal you already ate\", was her analogy. This may be the case if you order a meal, express the fact you are lactose intolerant, are reassured by the waiter that there won't be an issue, only to eat it and get horribly sick. Anyways, she immediately started talking over me and when she asked what I wanted her to do, it ended up being a rhetorical question. She didn't care. I asked for a refund on the gel upgrade, a total of $30. In response, she told me she didn't have time for me and proceeded to hang up on me. So kudos to Tina's for screwing me over!", "date": "2017-05-19 22:53:18}

I sought out the Escape I wanted online and went to take a look in person, not expecting to buy the vehicle. Denise was our salesperson and was very kind. She didn't pressure us whatsoever and was very informative. After taking a test drive, I decided to buy the vehicle. This is when things started to get a little shady. After Denise had pulled interest rates for us, we were escorted to the back by the finance guy Patrick. \n\nOur first impression indicated that we were about to endure an uncomfortable hour. Patrick made a comment that we were dressed \"awfully comfortable\" for the occasion because we were wearing sweatpants and hoodies. I wasn't aware that I was supposed to put on my stillettos and best sequined dress while browsing for cars... in February... in Cleveland, Ohio. Our interactions only got more awkward from then on out. Per usual we were offered additional warranties. My husband and I listened to and declined these offers and stated that we wanted to stick with the extended warranty we were given. Patrick asked why and we explained that my father is a mechanic and does all of our car maintenance. This apparently was not good enough for know-it-all Patrick. He asked if we've had a new car worked on lately, and that no neighborhood mechanic would have the skills to fix a car with recent technology. Of course he threw a \"no offense\" in there, as if we would not be offended that he just openly bashed my father, having zero knowledge of his expertise or background. He continued to push the warranties and kept throwing out figures, trying to trick us by offering lower monthly payments that we would make for only a \"few\" more months than we had planned. My husband continued to politely decline. Patrick asked why in the world we wouldn't want to lower our monthly payment, stating that we were crazy. My husband kindly said \"because even though we will have smaller payments, we will be making more payments and all in all spending thousands on a warranty that we don't want.\" After this, Patrick got defensive and said \"Well who will be the primary driver of the vehicle?\", knowing full and well that it would be me and not my husband (we had already told him this shortly after he gave us a verbal warning as the Fashion Police). I stated that it would be me and he said \"well what do YOU think about it?\" At this point, I was so annoyed that I almost got up and walked out carless. My husband and I exchanged looks of understanding and out of his true character, he had to loudly and firmly say (for the 400th time) that we were absolutely NOT interested. Patrick accused my husband of being aggressive even though he had done nothing but raise his voice to be heard. However, he finally quit hassling us and finished our paper work without saying anything more than \"I need your signature on this line.\"\n\nOver all, I would still consider our experience at John Lance Ford a good one. My car is perfect and it's everything I wanted! Denise was very thorough, kind and knowledgeable and I would highly recommend buying a car from her. Be prepared to get bombarded with warranties and bring your boxing gloves in case you have a run-in with Patrick.", "date": "2013-02-13 06:14:17}

There seem to be a lot of restaurants out there lately with a concept of selling burgers with crazy combos of stuff paired with giant milkshakes possibly containing alcohol, and I am more of a burger-with-onions-and-cheese person than burger-with-a-bacon-egg-and-waffle-breakfast-on-it person, so I figured this place would be just OK.  I was wrong.  The burgers are very, very good.  \n\nEven though I do not like burgers that are pink in the middle as the restaurant recommends you get them - medium well is as rare as I go. Even though the ones with combos of meat (a burger with BBQ pork on it, a burger with a pastrami reuben on it, etc.) are definitely not my taste.  Even though they cost 12 dollars.  Even though the restaurant, while containing some nice art, was uncomfortable - jammed with people, with an overly tiny table for the two of us, and not sufficient monitors for my friend to see the basketball scores (the only monitor I could see was directly over our heads, a dumb place to put it), and furnished in some industrial style with the type of uncomfortable \"design\" chairs and tables you expect to see in a museum cafe, and with insufficient surfaces to absorb the noise of conversation so it was like eating in a big echo chamber.\n\nEven with all of that, the burgers were still very, very good.  You can build your own combination, but I wanted to try one of the specials.  Finally picked the New Jack City one which had pepper jack cheese and peppers but didn't go so far as to slap some second kind of meat or egg on.  I really liked it - it was surprisingly mild. The bun was also just a great hamburger bun - it was not hard to chew, or pretzel style, or covered with a ton of seeds which can be hard to eat without getting them all stuck in your teeth (or in the case of some of my family, their dentures).   There is a condiment bar with lots of pickled stuff including sweet pickles, which I like a lot, so that's cool.  And the Lola fries were awetastic as they were actually crispy shoestring fries, which seem to be hard to find nowadays.  They do have a lot of rosemary on them, which turned off my dining companion but I like rosemary OK so more for me.  \n\nThe only food that was just sort of ordinary was the milkshake, which I guess makes sense since a milkshake is a milkshake and once you have good quality ingredients, there isn't much that a restaurant can do different from your own kitchen.  The milkshake was the size for about three meals, I will give it that.  But next time I'll probably have a beer. \n\nA solid four stars.

I travel often and the beds are very relaxing and the food is real good at breakfast. \n\nCons: There was no microwave on either rooms we stayed in, and also the coffee maker looks dirty with white stuff inside of it.", "date": "2014-03-25 18:12:12}

I boarded my dog and my sisters dog for 3 days and 2 nights.  This was my very first experience with boarding.  When I picked up the dogs I was shocked to see how dirty and smelly they were.  Clancy's paws and face were yellow and he smelled like urine.  Sophie wasn't as bad but that's probably because she's black so I couldn't see any discoloration.  To be honest, I expected the dogs to be a little dirty and smelly but not like that.  When I spoke to the owner the following day she didn't seem to care at all.  She was very laxidasical and said \"sorry we must have overlooked.\"  What?  How can you not notice a white dog with yellow paws??  I explained that this was my first experience with them and how disappointed I was.  The owner didn't seem to care at all.

However, please see for yourself before dropping your loved ones off for a week or even a day. I encourage you to download Camp Bow Wows app before you decide. \nMy wife was going on vacation. Trying to consider my long hours at work she took it upon herself to book our two dogs at the Westlake Ohio location. Unfortunately , she failed to do her homework. So, I decided to watch the live feed to see if my dogs were okay. After two days of watching twenty plus dogs in a \"bull-pin\" type in closed area with a small outside area which didn't offer any real grass or enough room to run, excersise , or simply play. I also noticed there were no toys. As I continued to watch, there was no human interaction. Family pets obviously need human interaction. The dogs were not being walked nor were they being taken outside for bathroom breaks and probably because it is  easier to mop a tiled floor opposed to cleaning artificial grass carpet. Also, I noticed one of the male staff members was sitting on this small landing of sorts in the center of the room. As the dogs were coming over to him for attention he would bat them away. This recording was on 7 /24/17 in the small pet area. These dogs sit in this room within an open warehouse. The \"bull-pins\" are sectioned off into groups of size and or tempermant as far as I understood. These dogs sit in this room by the door waiting within an atmosphere of very loud constant barking. \nIn my opinion, this place isn't good. I felt sorry for the dogs there when I nearly sped as fast as I could to rescue my two boys. After two days of watching the live feed, it was all I could take. Ask yourself. \" How can you expect your bet to rest without nervousness amongst constant loud barking. Camp Bow Wow distracts the reality as they use \"Camp\" as well as their \"cute\" play on words relating to \"k9', pet, dog and puppy. Notice when the dogs are out of the \"bull-pins\". There will be a memo stating the dogs are asleep from a busy day. Really? Your dog doesn't need a \"Camp\". They need attention, human interaction, behavioral  enforcement, bathroom breaks, walks. Most of all, \"A family setting\". \nWatch for yourself on Camp Bow Wows live feed. In my opinion. It is sad.", "date": "2017-07-28 06:39:53}

Comes with two nominal sides--fries and slaw, neither of which have impressed us in the past so we asked for the upgrade sides, which a manager promised would be a dollar more each.

Spinach was the same but much saltier.  Ditto for the salty sweet fries.\n\nProblem came when the check arrived.  We questioned the price adder for the side upgrades.

Had a groupon for $40 and decided to try them out since their close to home. I did make a reservation but it was definitely unnecessary. There was less than 20 people and this place is big. Was pleasantly surprised with the warm greeting and the fact they have Lienenkugel Summer Shandy. Nice scenery and great music.\n\nFor apps we did the tuna napolean and arancini (fried risotto). The tuna is rare, crusted, sitting atop a tortilla chip (kinda, they call it a wonton) with a dab of wasabi sauce. Very light, refreshing and unique. If you like seared tuna, try this. The fried risotto reminds me of a mozzarella stick topped with saut\u00e9ed onion and marinara sauce. This was really very good and more filling if you have a bigger appetite.\n\nEntrees were; filet mignon and bolognese pasta. These dishes were five stars in my book. The filet is cooked medium, to perfection. Seared and seasoned like an experienced steak house. With the spinach, crab, mashed potato and bearnaise sauce, this is the best $29 I have ever spent. The pasta made me think I was in little Italy. Fresh pasta, tons of meat, parm cheese and truffle. Words cannot describe how good this pasta dish was. I was extremely pleased with all of our choices.\n\nI hate the fact that this restaurant is not located in a more desirable area. I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience and I want other cool, young people to love it too.

The first time we came here it was amazing! We had a stuffed Pablano pepper that was out of this world. We also had two pasta dishes which were really good.  The ambiance was nice also. It really did steer towards the older crowd though.  They advertised events for the Rat Pack and a couple other music genres from that era.  \n\nThe second time we came was for Sweetest Day. We came for the Prime Rib special that they ran for every Friday I believe it was or it could have been Saturdays also..... We got the pepper again thinking it would be good but it wasn't as amazing as we remembered.  Don't get me wrong the food was still really good but the pepper wasn't as heavenly as we remembered......  We found out that the head chef that was there before when we first went had left.... His name was Mickey.  He opened a restaurant downtown. Which I can't think of right now......  His food is amazing. \n\nThose two times were about almost 1 year ago. So when we saw it changed ownership and they had a livingsocial deal out we had to try it.  We liked the original so much we wanted to see how much they lived up to the old name. Turns out that they kept a lot of the original staff and some menu items. The pepper was still on there but we didn't get it this time around.  We got a stuffed risotto ball for appetizers which were OK.  They could of been a little bit better.  I got the Bolognese and Bonson got the Chirizo pasta.  Both were really good. All their pasta is fresh from Ohio City Pasta which was awesome that they are supporting local businesses.  \n\nWhen we sat down it took a moment or two to get our server over to us. Then when she did finally come over she kinda was spacey in a way. Sort of like Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter but not as smart..... In a Luna Lovegood way.  She said that the bread would be over in a moment and that she was going to give us a moment to look over our menus. Well mind you it was not busy there yet at all. We went a little early so the dinner rush hadn't started yet.  The bread took about 5 minutes to come to our table. When they dropped it off they didn't tell us what the butter was at all. It was good but the way I found out what it was was by hearing it being explained to another table,  Then we sat there waiting for our server to come over and take our order.  Which she wasn't to busy to take it unless you want to say she was because she was flirting with the kitchen staff..... After she took our order everything came out pretty fast and smoothly.  Like I said everything was really good. Bonson ended up ordering dessert which was a Mint Creme Brulee. All desserts are made in house except the ice cream which is from Mitchells another local business. :)  \n\nThe Hostess was also amazing. Very upbeat and happy and also willing to answer any and all questions. She made a very good first and last impression. So Saucy food is still amazing and good service is a hit or miss. Just try and not get a Luna. :) This place would for sure get 4 stars if the service improved just a little bit more.", "date": "2012-04-19 18:22:28}

As far as the pedi is concerned, they aim to please and follow direction very well. They get five stars for an all around outstanding job. Keep it up guys and gals.", "date": "2012-07-13 17:57:22}

They gave us a bread basket when we sat down and it was so warm and delightful. Yum.\n\nThey knew I was celebrating my birthday and that it was our first time there, so they surprised us with two desserts with a candle in each :-) It really made my day.

The Cabin Club has a rustic feel on the inside, with close tables making for a \"bustling\" atmosphere.  The place was decorated for the holidays and it looked lovely.  Our server took great care of us the entire night, which we really appreciated.\n\nWe each ordered a (different) glass of red wine, in preparations for the steaks we would order later.  My wife was able to taste a few different varieties before settling in on her preferred glass.\n\nA basket of warm bread was brought to the table, along with butter.  The sourdough bread was yeasty and delicious, but the butter could have used a bit more pizzazz (it almost tasted like unsalted butter).\n\nMy wife ordered a Caesar salad and I had a cup of their French onion soup.  The soup was hearty and the onions almost transparent in color.  The melted cheese had the perfect amount of salty goodness to offset the both and onions...it was a great cup of soup!\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the filet mignon and my wife had the steak Christopher.  We each ordered them medium-rare+.  As a side to my steak, I got the creamed spinach and we also shared their famous sizzling mushroom platter (which the server suggested we get a half order of).\n\nMy steak arrived in perfect condition, but my wife's was much closer to rare.  The manager happen to be checking in on table who had recently received their dishes, so his arrival was perfect timing.  He apologized profusely and took my wife's dish back for some additional time under the broiler.  When it returned, it was just as she had ordered.  The quality of their meat is superb, and the accompanying Bearnaise dipping sauce hit the spot with tons of rich butter in it.  My creamed spinach was a mountain on my plate, and we took half of it home.  The sizzling mushrooms had to have been cooked in some sort of vinegar as they had a wonderful pop and kick when you bit into them.\n\nAs a show of good faith (due to the steak temp incident), our server offered to comp us a dessert and we chose their creme brulee which had an incredibly crispy crust and super-creamy custard underneath.  It was a great way to finish the evening and we appreciated everything the staff did to accommodate us throughout the meal.", "date": "2017-12-10 22:35:51}

We were seated quickly and drinks and chips and salsa came out immediately. The chips were average but they were not as greasy as other restaurants. The mild salsa was a little on the warm side but it was pretty bland. Not much in it. The hot salsa was pretty good but it is similar to the hot salsa as you get at many of the other Mexican restaurants. Our food order came out in about 10 minutes. Definitely one of the best fajitas that I have had from a Mexican restaurant in a long time. Barely any grease and the chicken was seasoned really well.

The famous fries are ala carte -- and they are fresh cut potatoes dusted with sea salt and rosemary. YUM!! \n\nLooking at the quick, one page menu - there is a large selection of brews, full bar drinks, sodas and malts/shakes!!! I tried the chocolate malt -- very full of malty goodness. However, I was very intrigued by the alcohol versions of the shakes. My next stop at the B Stop is sure to include a Kahlua & chocolate shake ... and a brat!! \n\nIt's a hip, cool, laid back place inside & out -- and it has at least 3 locations that I know of -- Westlake, Strongsville and a just-opened location inside the new Horseshoe Casino in downtown Cleveland. \n\nThe BEST of the B Spot -- aside from the food -- is the PRICE!!

Like my visit to its sister location at the Eton Center, the wait was long (1 hour for a table), but I managed to snag a single stool at the bar.\n\nI ordered a Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Shake with Bourbon, a Lola Burger, and a side of Lola Fries.  While the wait for a table was long, there certainly was no hold-up at the kitchen:  My food came out in under 5 minutes from ordering.  The promptness was appreciated but did seem a little suspicious to me.  The Lola Burger was fantastic--particularly as the bacon, red onions, cheddar, and mayo get encapsulated in the yolk from the fried egg sitting atop the thick patty.  It is a messy experience, so be sure to have a couple paper towel napkins at the ready.  The Lola Fries were very good as usual, and there are available accompaniments of Ketchup, Lola Ketchup (ketchup with a little more vinegar and spice to it--I wasn't particularly a fan), Stadium Mustard, Coffee BBQ Sauce, Balsamic Steak Sauce, and Shasha Sauce.  (I have no idea what the last three sauces are about.)\n\nHaving already been to the East Side location, the quality of the burger and fries were not really all that surprising.  I was surprised, however, by the milkshake, which I have not had before.  First, the milkshake is BIG--easily two full servings of the glass they give you to pour it into.  (I'd consider splitting it on future trips.)  Second, it is tasty--the vanilla base combines well with the cinnamon-apple taste and the hint of bacon, then accented by the little bits of bacon inside the shake that you can slurp up through the extra-wide straw.  The bourbon also gives a nice background flavor, though I would have preferred just a tad more in my shake.  What I really liked about the milkshake is that none of these flavors--even the sweetness of the cinnamon-apple--dominated the drink.\n\nService was friendly and attentive, and, as I mentioned before, my food came out lightning fast.  The space (formerly Agave) suits B Spot well.  The al fresco dining is nice, particularly from the effect of being near similar outdoor tables at Champps next door and across the street at Blake's and Hyde Park.  The tables inside were fairly well-spaced, though I wonder in the colder months whether they will make it much more crowded to accommodate enough people.  For now, the extra floor space gets occupied by people waiting for tables and partaking in a beer from the bar.\n\nBefore we all just run up to the top of the hill and hug, there are some negatives:  First, they give a warning when you choose how you want your burger cooked that B Spot usually cooks burgers one notch under what you order them at (e.g., medium rare when you order medium).  The obvious response is, well, why don't you just cook it one notch longer than you usually do?  I'm sure they would say something like it has to do with the thickness of the hamburger patties, but I don't think the patties, while a little thicker than your normal restaurant burger, are so incredibly thick as to be that unwieldy while cooking (as opposed to something like a super-thick patty at Kuma's Corner in Chicago).  Second, as some people have noted regarding other locations, B Spot seems to revel in a certain jerk attitude.  To be sure, the actual servers were friendly, and I can understand the aversion to substitutions.  But, I can do without the signs and the little laminated pamphlet calling me a whiny bastard for considering a substitution.  It is really a turn off and very very nearly merited dropping B Spot down to the three-star level in my book.", "date": "2011-07-15 03:33:01}

We got lucky the night we went and did NOT make a reservation, but one family happened to be leaving and it was a Sunday night. \n\nThe service was top-notch.  Great server - I wish I remembered her name.  She deserved the good tip we left her.  The Manhattan I had was great and the wine list, extensive enough, but not huge by any means.  They have a lot of awards for their wine list from back in the 90's, but it's clear that they haven't kept the large inventory up anymore, but it's not a big deal.  Just don't come here if that's what you heard.\n\nThere is no rib-eye on the normal a la carte menu, which surprised me...but I was pleasantly surprised when they had a bone-in rib-eye as a special that night, which was really, really good.  The lobster mashed potatoes were okay, but I'm not a huge potato fan.  \n\nEveryone really seemed to enjoy their meal and we had a great time.  Would definitely recommend it.  The only reason for not giving it a 5-star is b/c I've had better steak before with more selection at other steakhouses.  Otherwise, this place is great.", "date": "2012-04-21 01:33:56}

I really really wanted to like it. It's exactly what Crocker park needed, a modern Mexican restaurant. First impressions were incredible, really loved the decorations and smells and ambience.

Me and 3 others sat down for dinner and had chicken enchiladas, beef enchiladas, chicken tacos, grilled street corn, and one of their salads I don't remember which one. Beef enchiladas were extremely bland, the sauce it came with was congealed like it had been microwaved and the rice it came with was also flavorless. Chicken enchiladas were also bland but the queso on top was overpowering and just did not taste good. Chicken tacos were cold, not room temperature, cold. Not to mention the horrendous dressings that came with the salad and tacos. Finally the grilled street corn, something that should be flavorful and simple was nothing but grilled corn with hot sauce poured over top. Extremely disappointing, maybe I'll try it again in a year or 2 when they can figure out how to make good food.", "date": "2018-08-01 16:26:47}

It was seven or eight years ago and the name was Saucy Bistro. We had completely forgotten about our experience. Couldn't even remember what we had eaten or if the service was any good. Apparently it wasn't that memorable and, while we had yet to realize it, deja vu was about to set it.\n\nLike hundreds of others (and just about everyone the was dining there during our visit) we were lured in by the Groupon - $35 for dinner for two. Not a bad deal. An arancini appetizer, two salads and two entrees. Sure, there are some restrictions, but aren't there always? You can't choose the app and the entrees are price-capped at $24.\n\nOur dining experience started about 6pm on a Thursday. We walked in and that's when it hit me. The overwhelming smell of either air freshener or scented candles. Not good. The only thing I should be able to smell in a restaurant is the food. Isn't this restaurants 101? We stood there in the empty lobby staring at the empty host stand. Straight back there's a bar. What looks like a dessert case is filled with bottles of wine. Eventually, someone wanders up and takes us back to our table in the main dining room.\n\nThe kitchen is open to the dining room which I thought was a nice touch. A long banquette to the left, a few large round tables and some two-tops scattered about. There's a back dining area that I think features even more seating but given the sparse crowd I don't think it would be used that evening. The atmosphere was one of a wedding reception or the lido deck of a cruise ship. We were the youngest patrons in the restaurant by at least 25 years. Even the decorations on the wall featured old people. This must be where the Westlake retirement community holds their bridge meetings. Unless you have your AARP card and are prepared to complain about at least two food-related items you may feel out of place.\n\nOur server, his words dripping with a noticeable Eastern European accent, was OK. Not great, not horrible. Fitting for this place. When I informed him that we had a Groupon he actually put a piece of paper and a pen in front of me and said, \"You just write the number for me, OK?\" Seriously? Now I have to write things down for you? I was a bit annoyed by this. Anyway, let's move on. Overall, he was pretty attentive. Water glasses were always refilled and he checked back after each course. He did, however, neglect to bring our table a bread basket. Probably for the better. Saved me a few hundred empty calories.\n\nThe food, in a word, benign. Clearly catering to a generation that loathes seasoning and hot food, nearly every dish we were served lacked salt and arrived at the table just north of lukewarm. Here are the details:\n\nArancini - A pair of golden brown spheres, filled with rice, mozzarella cheese, and red onions atop a bed of marinara sauce and wilted spinach. While not the best we've had they would be the highlight of the meal.\n\nArugula salad - Arugula, pecans, goat cheese and three pair slices dressed in balsamic vinaigrette. The greens were fresh and dressed well but the salad lacked sweetness to balance the bite of the cheese and dressing.\n\nBittaker Salad - Mixed greens, tiny bits of cauliflower, bacon, goat cheese and what was called Bittaker dressing. I wasn't a big fan of this one. I couldn't really taste the bacon (again, itty bitty pieces) and the dressing, way too much for the salad, was cloying and sticky.\n\nBeef Short Ribs - Not a bad rendition of the classic comfort food. The beef, cooked in a tomato demi, was OK, albeit a little chewy at times. I expect short ribs to be melt in my mouth tender and these were not. My wife rather enjoyed the cauliflower, calling it a welcome reprieve from the typical mashed potatoes.\n\nSeared Duck Breast - I hadn't had duck in awhile so I was looking forward to this. Warm arugula walnut salad topped with a dollop of what tasted like mascarpone, oyster mushroom risotto and roasted rep pepper coulis. The meat was cooked to the requested medium but I found the fat to be a tad rubbery. Possibly the result of a pan that was too hot. The walnuts added some great texture to the slightly mushy rice and I rather enjoyed the red pepper sauce. Not bad just not mind-blowingly good.\n\nWhat can I say that would provide a succinct and justifiable summary for our SB Eightyone experience other than it was pretty good. Middle-of-the-road in just about every way, it felt like what would happen if you asked a 70 year-old restaurateur who had been out of the game for awhile to design a hip dining experience. A bit of a culinary anachronism. The Groupon helped to cushion the blow a bit. Without it our bill would have been $85 without tip (including two glasses of their cheapest wine). Maybe we'll come back in another seven years once we've forgotten about this visit.", "date": "2013-09-27 11:25:23}

When my tire pressure was low - they took me with no appointment, and apologized that it would be a 5-10 minute wait. That's all? I would have happily waited longer for this unplanned service. When my engine light went on, they listened to my concerns, took them seriously, and kept me informed throughout the day on the progress of my vehicle.

After going back and forth on where to go, my mom suggested B Spot. I had heard of it because there is one in Columbus where I live and an ex-boyfriend had made a big deal about it because he had seen it on TV. Also, since burgers and fries are my absolute favorite meal, I knew I had to try it out!\n\nWe got there in the late afternoon and I LOVED where we were sat. It was a super hot day..might have been in  the low 90s...but we were sat right on the edge of the patio and the inside. It was perfect! They have like an open seating area/patio and they must have doors/walls that can push off to the side to create an open area. It was absolutely ideal because we got the pleasure of sitting outside with the added luxury of AC coming from the inside. So refreshing!\n\nWe had a server who was nice and attentive. He had a trainee with him whom he introduced. He went over details with me and my family. He mentioned one thing that I didn't love which is that the fries come a la carte. Boooo!!! Cmon! If this is a burger place, fries should come with the burger entree, that's a given! I've been to one other burger place like that and I just am not a fan. Lose a star right there.\n\nI ordered a classic burger (cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion), fries (without rosemary) and a chocolate shake. I was happy to hear from our server that they could do fries without the rosemary as I cannot stand that particular herb. My chocolate shake came out quickly but honestly I felt like it was chocolate ice cream that was blended for 2 seconds and then thrown over to me with an empty glass (they allow you to put it in the glass straight from the mixer container). It was SOOO thick! However, since we were so close to outside and it was so hot out, it melted quickly. I really enjoyed the shake. It tasted exactly like Graeter's chocolate ice cream for those of you who are familiar with Graeter's.\n\nWhen I got my burger and fries, I loaded it up with mayo and ketchup and took a bite. Hmmm it was just okay. Not as much as the hype that was apparently behind it. For some reason I felt like the burger patty tasted more like meat loaf than a burger. I didn't think there was as much flavor as I've had at other burger joints. The fries were okay too. They are like shoestring fries. Could have used more seasoning (seasoning other than rosemary).\n\nSo all in all, since they specialize in burgers (and burgers are my fave) and I wasn't overly impressed, that's where they get an average rating. I loved the outdoor seating and location and the shake was great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a burger and fries. Worth trying at least once though!", "date": "2018-09-12 00:18:07}

When we tried to order some chips with our drinks while we were waiting, we were told that WE COULD NOT ORDER JUST AN APPETIZER we had to order all our food at once. \n\nOur server said her manager would not allow her to place our order unless that was all we would be eating this evening.  Seems kind of strange that you would discourage customers from ordering - but that was the deal.  We explained that someone else would be joining us and that we wanted to order dinner later - and we were told that we shouldn't have been seated until our entire party had arrived.  (Well, we WERE the entire party when we were first seated!).   My friend politely told the waitress that this was absurd.  As the server left to get the manager, we walked out.  \n\nI mean, really?  We didn't want to drink without some food to go along with the alcohol, and we didn't want to wait until our third person arrived before ordering so we gave up and walked across the street to Bar Louie.  They were not only happy to serve us WHATEVER we wanted WHEN we wanted it, they had great happy hour drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers!  (bonus!)  \n\n(If you haven't tried Bar Louie's fried calamari, I strongly suggest you do so at the very next opportunity.)\n\nBut I've been ruminating all evening.. WHY this policy?

Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about.\n- The server was very attentive, and took good care of us and our 2 year old. She made sure he had a cup with a lid and extra napkins. It's the little things.\n\nCons:\n- Chips were definitely not fresh. Maybe made much earlier in the day, and I'm spoiled, but I love freshly made tortilla chips.\n- The salsa was bland and goopy. Not pleasantly chunky, or appropriately runny - just not that great. \n- The food, overall, was fine. Not great, not bad. It was, as I said, overpriced. A burrito grande (or whatever they call a burrito with chicken, doused in cheese sauce) was $10.99. Most places that's a $8-9 burrito. \n- The house margarita was definitely a mix, and light on the tequila.

Cantina Laredo was in such a state when I came and I have to agree with other reviewers that the designer really classed things up. It's elegant enough to wear a nice summer dress to, but also casual enough for your kids (or dad) in their T-shirt and sandals. The menu is a large tri-fold containing lunch, dinner, and drink items. \n\nService - suave as can be. I couldn't tell by the staff that this restaurant was new. Our waiter was courteous, gracious, and knew just when to step in to check in on us with another glass of water or refill on chips and salsa. Yes, free chips and free salsa. Which were quite good - just enough heat to keep you wanting more. We ordered the Top Shelf Guacamole because we were curious about all the dimsum style carts being pushed around, and while it was entertaining for about 30 seconds to watch the ingredients being mixed together, we could barely see and the amount of guacamole produced is probably only enough for one person, let alone a shared appetizer. And a $10.50 one at that. It was delicious, but instead, cut the show fee and gimme more guac! \n\nThe Cancun dish is made for those who want it all, a sampler of the essentials. Nothing here really stood out to me, and in fact the whole dish gave off the vibe that it was everyone else's leftovers arranged in parallel lines.

Then the assistant manager came out because he figured out there was a problem and asked If I was in neutral because the second attendant had already pushed the button to push my car through. Because I had my foot on the brake, the car didn't move. The assistant manager asked what was wrong. I explained the bug situation , the second attendant's attitude was awful and didn't care if I went somewhere else. He said he would make a note of it. \nHow about cleaning the bugs off my car????\nThey don't care about keeping customers. \nI've been to lots of car washes that will brush the front of the car and spend more than a few seconds \"spraying\". \nSergeant's \"owned and operated by veterans\" sounds great but my experience was lacking effort other than a light spray to the front of my car and windshield.

Upon checking in this was not mentioned.....the host should have said welcome to the area.  They are not taking full advantage of Open Table.  Restaurants pay no attention to the comments in open table reservations.  This would earn extra points. \nIt is a bit noisy due to the hard surfaces but not impossible to hear a conversation.  Our server Julianne was very pleasant and helpful at the beginning but brought wine instead of the bubbly we ordered.  She did fix this promptly. They serve their bubbly in a regular wine glass which is not ideal especially for a higher end restaurant. We had to pour our own refills of bubbly(not acceptable!) and our server did not check on us until long after someone else brought our entrees.  The check had both the wine and bubbles on it.  We had to flag the manager to correct this.\nThe worst part and this seems common in the area, smokers are permitted to gather and smoke at the entrance of the building...you get choked out coming in and leaving.  Really? Can you not take a few steps away from the building to kill yourself?\n\nWe will be back for the food and atmosphere alone.", "date": "2018-08-26 13:26:19}

The boss or supervisor repeatedly told the employee \"your numbers are in the 30% to 40% range, and everyone else's are around 80%\" which I took to mean the employee he was berating was not successful in selling things to customers who do not want those services or products.

As for myself an extra $8 for a lotion he said would cure cracked heels...... that's comical. So $50 pedicure.

So when I saw the wine bar by the Apple store, it was a no-brainer. Walking in, I saw a sign instructing us to seat ourselves. The decor was really nice, dim lighting with high wooden ceilings. It was relaxing and cozy and I was super excited to snag a couch in the far corner of the room. We sat down and our waitress, a girl with long straight dark hair, came to give us our menus, she asked if we saw a checkbook lying around the couch or tables and we all took a quick look around and couldn't find anything. She left so we could peruse the menu. Since I just wanted a drink, I picked one out fairly quickly. My boyfriend doesn't drink so he was quite happy with the surprisingly delicious cucumber water. \n\nWhen our waitress came back, I ordered my drink. She had this expression on her face that made me feel uncomfortable, as if she was annoyed with me for only ordering a drink and nothing else. I have a pet peeve about that sort of thing, and seeing that the restaurant was not crowded in the least bit- there were several empty tables- it wasn't like I was \"stealing\" a table from a potential big spender who'd would have to give her a big tip. So already, my visit had an awkward start. \n\nFeeling unnerved, I felt like I had to order something to appease our waitress so I ordered some Old School Tots when she came back with my drink. I wasn't hungry in the least bit and was in no mood to order a $10 appetizer so yes, I ordered the lowest priced vegetarian option I could find. She gave me the same annoyed expression and this time, my boyfriend noticed there was some subtle hostility. Then, a couple other waiters and I think, the general manager, came back over to us three separate times trying to find the missing check book. At one point, my boyfriend was on the floor using a flashlight on his iPhone to help look, and no one apologized for disrupting our night. I felt bad about the missing check book, we had not seen it at all during our entire visit, but the lack of communication between all the servers was seriously getting on our nerves by then. At one point, I had wondered if they thought that WE had taken the check book.\n\nNot surprisingly, our waitress had completely forgotten to bring us our appetizer. The whole night, we could clearly see her over by the kitchen chatting with one of the guys behind the kitchen counter and ignoring us. By the time she finally came over to ask us if \"everything was okay,\" it had been 30 minutes, my wine was nearly gone and I had given up on the tots. We just asked for the check only to be kept waiting for another 20 minutes. Finally, she came close to our table to clean up someone else's table and my boyfriend had to call across to her for the check a second time. We wasted no time paying and getting the heck out of there.\n\nI was very disappointed because the wine bar seemed like it had a lot of potential. I know the main problem was the service, so I do plan on coming back another time and giving it another chance with a different server.", "date": "2012-02-19 17:49:44}

Although they were not happy with my decision, they grudgingly said they would get my car ready.  Low and behold, I go to pick up my car, sit in the driver's seat and stare at a new 15\" long crack in the windshield!!!  This is a 2015 X1 and I baby this car!  Luckily, I did not even drive this car from the lot and called the service manager to come take a look.  He tells me to call in the morning.\n\nLong story short... The service advisor that I dealt with denies any responsibility on behalf of the dealership.  Then I talk to the service manager who also denies responsibility.  All the while, I am treated by these two on the phone like some sort of criminal who is trying to scam them.  They conjecture that there was a crack there previously or that a pre-existing crack extended itself.  The fact remains that there was no crack in the windshield when I dropped the car off and a 15\" crack is present when I pick the car up.  Finally, the service manager does agree to have the windshield replaced.  Am I happy?  No, I'd rather have my un-cracked original BMW windshield rather than a non-OEM replacement that seems to make excessive noise on the highway.  No, I'd rather have been treated like a valueable customer than a shady scam artist. \n\nIn the end, you decide where you buy your vehicle and where you take your vehicle for servicing.

I'll admit I have shopped this Giant Eagle several times even though each time has been more disappointing than the last, but it's close so sometimes it works (occasionally to pick up bottled water). Let me start off by asking if anyone else has noticed this horrid smell upon entering? Disgusting. Staff have been continuously rude especially at the service desk which is laughable. I have celiac disease which means gluten is not apart of my diet. Not a big deal these days since grocery stores are very accommodating especially the last few years. Well this last visit to the ever so stinky Giant Eagle was definitely my last. \n\nPrior to entering the store there were no less than 7 employees smoking at the designated smoking area in front of the store. I realize this is where they are allowed to smoke, but nevertheless its disgusting. I usually bring my toddler son along on my walks around Crocker so naturally I walked to the opposite side of the smokers and explained to my son why. Upon doing so I was called a stuck up B (by one of the employees)! This was not the only less than stellar language I heard while walking past the employees. Some were in dust covered aprons which I imagine means they work in the bakery? Again, just an assumption, but once again DISGUSTING! \n\nAt this point I really considered walking past and going straight to five guys, but I really just wanted a GF pizza. So I went against my best judgement and walked into Giant Eagle. Upon entering I noticed my beloved gluten free section has been replaced by various beers and booze. Fine. Where is the gluten free section these days? One employee inquired \"well what are you looking for? Cake?\" Haha. Not a single employee knew where I could find gluten free food as they are remodeling. That's fine. Sometimes there is chaos during a remodel. I get it. What I don't get is how I went through the entire store and found one tiny freezer section of frozen waffles, a couple loafs of bread, and a few frozen dinners. Oh, and there was one pizza among the gluten pizzas. \n\nSo in closing I want to thank Giant Eagle for being transparent with their employee smoking policy or lack there of. I also want to thank them for continuing to allow their store to smell like a public restroom. From a family who spends $600+ a week on groceries we WILL NOT be back.

We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and had a \"Winter vegetable roll\". It was essentially a rice paper roll filled with julienned root vegetables and deep green salad greens. There were edible flower petals in that roll, too. Very refreshing and light. The plates were very well presented. There was an orangey dipping sauce. Piquant. It was a fun way to eat a salad. Then we shared a small plate of artichoke hearts stuffed with asiago cheese and coated with panko crumbs. This was served on micro greens with a variety of dipping sauces. Very tasty. At this point, feeling happy, we decided to try the \"wine flight\" concept. In the center of the room are two cruvinet-type wine storage/dispensing machines. You buy a card loaded with how many dollars you want to load it with, get glasses from the server or bartender,  go over and choose whatever wine you want from the display, put your preloaded card into the slot,  place your empty wine glass under the chosen spigot and press the button. Voila! Two ounces of wine in your glass. If you want more, just press the button again and you will be rewarded. It's a great way to try wines you've never had before from many regions and of varying price ranges. If you like the wine, you can choose to order that by the bottle or the glass as well. Two ounces is not much. We were still in snacking mode, so we had a tuna \"poke\", which was a martini-glass shaped vessel embedded in ice and filled with seared rare ahi tuna layered with \"Poke\" seasonings and avocado. This came with very thin flatbread pieces. Yummy as all get out. Poke is a traditional Hawaiian dish, and this was a faithful version of that. We could have gone on and on, as every single menu item sounded delightful. Grilled cheese sandwiches, short ribs, cedar salmon, lots of different cheeses, lobster nachos, crab and lobster bisque, desserts and so on. It's a neat concept because you can eat as much or as little as you like, and you can eat as healthily or as decadently as you like. Everyone was friendly and smiling. \nUpdate: we went back. We decided not to do the \"wine flight machine\" again; it was decidedly fun, but pricey. If you are dying to taste a certain wine without making a major commitment, it may be a good way to go, but ordering by the bottle or glass is more practical. We sat at the bar again, and we had a different experience this time. The food was good, but our perception of the place changed dramatically because the bartender had the personality of the proverbial wet noodle. This can really put a pall on the \"fun quotient\" wherever you go. If you're hungry you will end up spending a lot of money. The small-plate prices add up quickly. We also tried sitting at various other places in the room, and it became apparent that all you could do at the \"comfy sofa areas\" is drink, because the tables are much too small to hold anything other than beverages. \nUpdate: We went again, got a fun server/bartender, and had another good experience. The food is solidly delicious. The last few times we've been by at lunch time, however, they haven't been open.", "date": "2008-04-11 19:54:36}

The place has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Case in point.  I took my wife and daughter there tonight, after my little girl had a visit and photo op with the Crocker Park Santa.  We were all in a great mood, until I bit into bony gristle in my cheeseburger, not once, but twice!  Disgusting!  Spitting a mouthful of bread and meat out into my paper towel napkin must have been quite the unpleasant sight for my family and nearby patrons!  The burger also seemed dry and much less flavorful than during my previous visits.  In addition, they got rid of the chili cheese fries (I knew this from previous visits, but never mentioned it online), and the coffee was too strong.  We ordered the regular fries, and the server brought them to our table in a large metal container, with fries falling out all over the table.  The fries themselves were of the super thin variety, which reminded me of McDonald's or other fast food fries!  They were unimpressive in the taste department.  Also, the men's room has no paper towels, which I needed to open the door handle while exiting, so I don't get any bacteria or viruses on my hands before handling my burger!  I don't mind the hand air drying part, but having no paper towels is ridiculous.  What added insult to injury was the ridiculously high bill of around fifty dollars (excluding tip) for a party of 2 adults and a child, for a gourmet burger experience that was dissapointing.  Sorry B-Spot, but you have been dethroned by the much better, tastier 'The Rail' in North Olmsted.  I've been there a few times lately, and B-Spot doesn't compare!", "date": "2014-12-17 03:42:48}

I normally go to a long hair specialty salon, however with a vacation coming up I wanted to try to save a little bit of money. So when I saw a Groupon for the salon, and saw it had pretty decent reviews I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe first issue came when I tried to book my appointment via the Yelp app. At the top of their page there was a link that offered you to book your appointment online. I did so and booked for a cut. Later upon realizing that my Groupon was for a cut and deep conditioning treatment I contacted the salon via email asking if I needed to add additional time to the appointment for the deep conditioning treatment. When the salon called me back they told me they had no record of my appointment. They asked how I booked and I informed them through the Yelp app. They told me they did not offer any type of online booking, and did not have an appointment for me, but offered to book the appointment at that time. They didn't apologize for the confusion, and acted like I was just making it up, but you can clearly see where it says 'Book An Appointment' on the page. I also read them the confirmation email I received, and they said they \"don't do that\" and didn't know where that came from. I'm just glad I contacted them or else I would have walked in with no appointment. \n\nMy appointment was on a Thursday afternoon with a stylist named Meg C. Meg did a thorough consultation and was polite and friendly. She cut my hair and gave me a curled round brushed blowout (which is how I mentioned to her that I like to wear my hair.) I suppose the error was both of our fault since I should have asked her to style it straight, that way she could have checked the cut afterwards. However, because she round brushed it out and it was curled she was unable (as was I) to see where the cut was very blunt in the back and the layers a little shorter on one side. \n\nI called the salon later that evening after I ironed out my hair and saw the error, and some rude girl begrudgingly offered to book me an appointment on Saturday morning with Meg again. On Friday after looking at my cut more closely I realized that I was really unhappy with it. I called the salon and asked to speak to a manager, and asked her if there was someone else who could fix my hair who is more experienced with long hair. (The reason I asked this was because I considered maybe long hair just wasn't her thing. As a former hairdresser myself I know we all have have our favorite things to do.) The manager I spoke to was very rude and basically told me she didn't believe me that my cut was uneven. She told me she was \"shocked\" and that Meg was their \"best stylist,\" and that Meg is the one who does her hair. She told me there was really no one else she could recommend since Meg was their best stylist. She also said that since I came in with a Groupon that my hair could only be fixed by another girl who takes Groupons. \n\nI thought that was a little bit ridiculous and realized at that point that the salon really doesn't care about client retention. Typically when you go back for a redo they will bump you up to a higher level stylist to ensure your cut is satisfactory, and to try to keep you as a client. The manager pretty much left me no real option, and so I told her it was fine I would go back and see Meg, and that if they really thought she was the best stylist then I felt confident trusting her to fix the cut- especially because I know even the best stylists have an off haircut every once in a while. However, I was still pretty annoyed that the manager didn't believe me (even after I offered to come back to the salon right then to show her my hair just to prove to her what I was saying), nor did she apologize, and was just completely unhelpful.\n\nI went back in on Saturday morning and Meg fixed my hair, no problem. It took less than 15 mins, she was polite and friendly, and I tipped her again. After she said goodbye the girl sitting behind the desk (Kayla?) w/ reddish purple hair smugly asks, \"Are you happy with your hair now?\" I told her yes, it was an easy fix, and walked out. \n\nI will definitely not return to the salon again. Meg wasn't a horrible stylist, and I would probably trust her to cut my hair again. She was never rude to me, and I saw several other nice stylists working. But the rest of the staff had horrible stink faces on, every person I spoke to on the phone was rude, and the treatment from the \"manager\" was unacceptable. In the future I would much rather cough up the $75 for my other stylist, because saving the money was not worth all of this. It's unfortunate when an otherwise decent stylist loses a potential long term client because of the lack of professionalism from other team members. I honestly would not recommend this salon.", "date": "2016-09-10 15:09:57}

I paid for an extended warranty that took over 6 months of repeated phone calls and emails to get completed. They took my money at the time of sale and did nothing for months. Now a year and a half after I bought my car I got a nail in my tire and the dealership by my home told me I have no warranty on the wheels and tires. I was told when I bought the car it had the wheel and tire coverage until 2018. \n\nI have send several emails and made phone calls to resolve this and have gotten zero response from anyone who can help me.

We were a group of 40 who had a choice of 5 menu items and alerted the restaurant of the choices before our reservation tonight, so everything should have been ready for us.  There were 5 tables and our table happened to be in the middle so we were told that we would have 2 servers so they could split the room.  That didn't happen, so our table was treated like the red headed step-child.   Our group started arriving at 5:30 and the last people showed at 6:00.   At 6:20, we still didn't have a server to take our drink order.   Finally, when drinks arrived, 2 people got Long Island iced teas and they were vastly different.   One was loaded with Coca-Cola and the other wasn't.   We were brought a plate of bread and butter at 6:30.  Once everyone took a piece, there were 2 left.   We asked for more bread, waited awhile and nothing happened.   Our salads finally came in an awkward way, with one server delivering salads and the other handing out small containers of salad dressing.  The salad was just bagged salad with one cherry tomato and one slice of cucumber.  We again asked for bread, so our server (Mary) walked over to another table and asked if they were going to eat their bread and since they said no, she brought it to us.   Do I need to say HEALTH CODE VIOLATION?  We couldn't believe it.\n\nFood finally started coming out, and of course all other tables were half done eating before ours came out.  5 people at our table had steak and the server didn't know how the steaks were cooked and just started handing them out.   One guest had prepared her baked potato with butter and sour cream, and then cut her steak and ate a piece and said that it was well done and she wanted medium.   The server took her plate to the other end of the table and told that guest that they needed to switch plates.  When told about the potato, she took a fork and picked up the steak and told the guest to switch it with the other one.   OMG! I can't believe this happened in a restaurant.  My salmon was bland, the vegetables were stone cold and the baked potato was only warmish.  My husband had ordered the pork chop and his meal wasn't delivered until we were 80% done with our meals.   We twice asked the server where his meal was and instead of being apologetic, she announced that it wasn't her fault,  but the kitchens fault.  Again, OMG, this isn't really happening.  \n\nWe asked if there were any dessert choices because we weren't offered any as they just brought our check.   Our server yelled over to the other server to tell us the desserts.   They clearly didn't want us to order dessert, coffee, or drinks.   Who does that???????\n\nMy husband had enough and went and spoke to the manager, who apologized, recognized there were health code violations and said he would talk to the server.   To top it all off, there was a mandatory gratuity.  This server deserved nothing with her awful attitude and service.  The manager would do nothing for us and has totally lost any future business from us, our family and friends, as we will be sure to spread the word.\n\nRun away as fast as you can.", "date": "2017-05-26 01:10:34}

We recognize that the service may be a little slower than normal and there can be confusion. To mitigate this, as it often the case for large group dining, our group of nearly 30 pre-ordered our entr\u00e9es from a selection of four items.\n\nSeated at a table of 8, as luck would have, it we were the last to place drink orders and to confirm our entr\u00e9e orders. When (almost) all of the entr\u00e9es at our table were served, the kitchen failed to mark the temperatures on each of the steak entr\u00e9es.

Another person at our table cut her steak and said that it was cooked medium and not medium well. \n\nRATHER THAN TAKE BOTH PATRONS PLATES BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND WITHOUT DISCUSSION, THE SERVER PULLED THE PLATE OUT FROM UNDER THE FORMER PERSON, TOOK IT TO THE LATTER PERSON AND USED THE PATRON'S FORK TO SWITCH STEAKS!!! \n\nAFTER HAVING REQUESTED MORE BREAD TWICE, WITH NONE DELIVERED, WE REMINDED OUR SERVER, AT WHICH POINT SHE WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE AND ASKED IF THEY NEEDED THEIR UNEATEN BREAD AND SET DOWN AT OUR TABLE!! \n\nTHAT IS TWO STATE HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS!! \n\nOh, and my entr\u00e9e was only delivered after everyone in our entire group had eaten half of their meal.

We were going to have dinner at one of the restaurant's there but after returning to our car to store our packages just decided to head home and eat some place closer to home.  On our drive down Crocker to catch I-480 we happen to notice the sign for Daddona's in a small plaza on Crocker.  We knew Jimmy Daddona's (a Solon institution we have been going to for years) had a west side location but did not have a clue where it was.  Since we always enjoyed the food at Jimmy's we decided to pop in and check the place out.\n\nWe had planned to just sit at the bar but upon being greeted by the host was informed  that while they had a full liquor license (beer, wine, liquor), they did not have a actual bar.  He suggested a cozy booth near the front, as the booth's in the back of the restaurant were occupied, and it was actually perfect.  It was a bit busy for a Tuesday night (holiday season I guess) with some larger parties.  The host returned quickly with water and mentioned that Mike would be our server, but he was currently occupied with a larger table and that he would be starting us off.  We noticed a Meomi Pinot Noir on the wine list, one are favorites.  We had intended to only get a glass but it was only offered by the bottle so we decided go for it as we were told they could cork it for it if we did not finish.  \n\nWhile the host went off for our wine we, noticed and observed with a bit of amusement and appreciation the young man who we eventually would find out was our server Mike.   He was occupied with a table of eight about 10 feet from our booth and boy was he occupied.  It looked like the table from  hell; people spoke at him all at once, asking a million questions and asking the same ones over and over as he went around.  Despite this he appeared very pleasant and patient.  Moreover, on a couple of occasions during this theater we were enjoying, he notice us and smiled, mouthing that he would be right with us.  We were having such a good time watching it was no big deal, especially since our wine was brought out promptly by the host.\n\nMike eventually escaped the table, checked on a couple of his other tables (he seemed to have about 4-5 others) and approached us and apologized for the delay.  It actually had not been that long and in the mean time we had been well taken care of by the host.  Mike ended up being one of the best servers we had at a restaurant in a long time.  Despite the fact he was clearly busy he spent a fair amount of time with us discussing the menu and the two specials offered that evening.  The menu was slightly different from the Solon menu, but all our long time favorites were listed (chicken marsala, the best lasagna in town and the tomato cream pasta with chicken to name a few).  We noticed the west side restaurant had a strip steak listed, prepared a number of ways, which does not appear on the Solon menu.\n\nWe decided to take our time and ordered the mussels olio to start as we sipped our wine.  We order mussels all over town, but we always enjoy Daddona's in the olio sauce (which we soup up with their well know garlic rolls) the most.  We know what large portions you get, and we planned to order dessert, so we ended up splitting our entr\u00e9e (3 dollar plate charge) and ordering an extra salad (one comes with the meal...in fact salads or wedding soup are included with all entrees).  Even though we had just polished off a bowl full of mussels, we could not resist ordering the fruit di mare, an old time favorite of ours, which includes mussels, shrimp and scallops served over linguine in a calm sauce.  It tasted just as good if not better than the Solon restaurant.  Even though the restaurant was busy everything came out timely and Mike checked on us a number of times to make sure everything was alright.\n\nLike I said we ended our meal with the cheese cake (served with a raspberry sauce) we have been chowing down for years in Solon.  We just cannot resist as it simply the best, and as explained by the host who served it (and something we already knew), it is made by the owner's mother.  Things slowed down at this point and Mike was able to chat with us a bit.  We discussed the large table he seemed to be having so much fun with through out the evening (it only got better as the night went on) and we had a couple of good chuckles about the experience, although he was very polite about the table.  If Mike is working I would definitely ask for him if he is available.\n\nGood food, good service...a great family owned reataurant.", "date": "2015-01-04 20:00:41}

You get to listen to a 90 minute presentation and then get your \"free tickets\". Well, if you are bored and need a couple hours of comedy relief, check out the Now Or Never Travel Club presentation. Now, you have to go in KNOWING you have 100% chance of NOT getting any free airline ticktes. You would have a better chance of finding Bigfoot in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. I was counting on some free refreshments, but this outfit was even too cheap for that. Bottom line is they want you to pony up $9500.00 (which by the time we left had dropped to $2100.00) to join their travel club with \"11 million members\" (nearly TWICE the population of Ohio). You get the royal treatment with all 3 of the \"co-owners\", (Mr. Richard Kenney, Co-owner Mr. Johnathan K. Robinson, Co-Owner Ms. Jennifer Zavesky), being involved. Rick and John give you the \"folksy\" talk complete with stories about the grandkids and ten start with the usual \"used car salesman pitch\". It is amazing to think that the headquarters of an 11,000,000 member club is located in a small rented office in Ohio. It is all very entertaining and the fact that anyone would actually hand over five or ten thousand to these yahoos is laughable to me. Of course they offer a super incentive if you buy tonight and (amazingly) someone did. I would say the chances that the \"buyers\" were \"plants\" is about 100%. \n\nThis is not Mr. Kenney's first experience in the travel business, but that is another story. Anyway, after they finally determine that you are NOT falling for the scam their aw shucks attitude changes and they finally give you the info for the \"free airline tickets\". Of course, they don't actually HAVE the voucher for any tickets there, you have to mail in some extensive paperwork to an unregistered company in Arizona along with a small \"fee\" of $75.00 via registered mail. Oh, and IF you would actually get the tickets(which from reviews I have read is extremely unlikely) there is another cost of $75.00 per ticket with a max travel benefit of $500 for the two. A final desperate incentive there was also some paperwork for a \"free\" 8 day seven night resort vacation (another scam....another story).\n\nAll in all, an entertaining and cheap evening for someone with a free night, but if you are looking for excitement spend the money you would use on gas and buy some lottery tickets.", "date": "2012-03-02 13:46:23}

My first time here the bartenders seemed cranky that a 20 something year old, non-regular bar guest would even sit at the bar. They seemed rude and uninviting. I felt out of place. But the food is cheap, and good. It's Flavorful, with large, filling portions. Extensive menu choices and multiple daily specials always kept me from deciding what I want  and kept me coming back. \n\nFinally, after maybe the 3rd visit, the bartenders warmed up to me. Im a regular now. They know my drink. They invited me to join their lunch club. They are friendly and attentive. \n\nThe value alone of this restaurant is worth checking out, even if you're in the younger age bracket.

Decent quality food, if bland and uninspiring, and an ultra trendy atmosphere.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  I usually review the food first, but as food is not the focal point, I'll concentrate on what is obviously the most important thing. The space is really cool.  The front of the restaurant is a giant window, perfect for people watching.  The place is decorated in deep reds and polished wood with cool modern-ish art on the walls.  The effect is more undifferentiated, sexy Latin than Mexican.\n\nTHE SERVICE:  Very friendly and responsive.  Our waitress was very pleasant.\n\nTHE FOOD:  The quality of the ingredients is very good.  However, this is ultra Americanized Mexican.  Mon cher chou had a burrito, served loosely wrapped, meant to be eaten with a fork and knife.  He said that all the ingredients were very good-- it wasn't as if they used the melange to cover up sloppy preparation.  I had the shrimp fajitas.  There were 8 shrimp on a giant bed of grilled onions and peppers.  The Mexican rice was well made and flavorful.  The guac was serviceable and smooth.  Margueritas were standard.\n\nIt blows my mind that more restaurants in Crocker Park don't have kids menus.  Crocker Park!  That paeon to suburbia!  Agave's owners were wise enought to develop a really nice kids menu-- 8 selections, each for $6.  It includes some American food and kids' versions of quesadillas and burittos.  You can choose from one of several sides-- rice, Mexican rice, etc. and FRUIT!!!  How nice not to have to feed your child fries!  The fruit cup was great--albeit miniscule.  There were fresh berries, apples and pineapple.\n\nAll in all a decent place to grab a bite if you are not expecting authentic Mexican food, but just want something tasty.", "date": "2008-12-18 15:41:54}

To me it's like an artificial wait list to make it seem like everyone's dying to get in here. Artificial demand? I have an idea, maybe build them twice the size & u won't have a long ass line out the door. They're all tiny. It must be part of the plan. \n\nWaitress overworked, most of them completely frazzled by end of day. Coffee takes a long time, I think waiting on clean cups. Fresh water??  Ha. We tried. And tried. I could open a de-salinization plant faster I think. End of it all we still leave a nice tip. U have to. It's not her fault the place is a zoo. \n\n100% family time in there. It crawls with children, not so much that they eat anything but what else are u gonna do with them on Sunday kind of thing. Loud, crowded, hot. Slow. But the food is good. Ave Maria we're punting next time. Aladdin's it will be.  That place has her own set of problems (I.e. it's the chick flick of restaurants) but we're Lebanese so there. \n\nMaybe I shouldn't have written this but I gotta be me. 3 stars. It's good. Just not my thing.", "date": "2018-08-26 18:53:06}

But the taste? It comes up bland a lot of times. I've been to this location and the one out by Whole Foods on the east side. That location would probably get an extra star - their food comes out piping hot and seems to haven been salted for flavor (what an idea!). This location? Not so much. My food is always lukewarm at best and nothing tastes that good. I've had their special - the Huevos Rancheros - and it's ingredients are delightful, but I could make a better dish at home. \n\nI must mention that yesterday morning we got a free entr\u00e9e for the boyfriend's birthday (just join the Sun eClub online for your very own). And the food was again - just ok. He had muesli pancakes (a new addition to the menu) and I had the Bacado Omelet with egg whites. When I went to log calories after that meal I was pleasantly surprised that nutritional info was available on First Watch's website but then I was abruptly slapped in the face by the 75, yes SEVENTY-FIVE grams of fat just in the omelet I consumed. Be careful what you order.\n\nSome final tips - \n1. If you must wait on a Saturday or Sunday morning, grab a coffee at the front  (its complimentary, a nice touch) and snag one of the cushy arm chairs (it makes the wait seem way shorter).\n2. If you choose wisely (read: not the Bacado omelet), you can get a healthy breakfast, brunch, or lunch here.\n3. Parking is available around the corner by The Gap & Coach or you can snag a spot in the parking garage directly to the right of the building.\n4.

There are a few chairs in the back which have cloth seat back covers but the remainder of the chairs are just plain and uncomfortable.  The pages on my menu were very dirty.  This could have been easily remedied by putting in a fresh printed sheet.   The \"house Italian\" salad dressing looked and tasted like it came from a bottle (stayed emulsified the whole time it sat on the table).  When I asked for freshly grated Parmesan, I was told that they don't have any but that they \"put the Romano cheese into the shakers themselves\".

I don't feel our large group should have been an issue but service was slow.  Refills were non-existent, even when we wanted to purchase an additional bottle of wine.

I think I am the first one. And here is why: I think I figured out new dieting tip. It is a well-know fact that American society over-eats. But hardly anyone knows why. I think the problem is that in this country we go to eat to places where we are expected to eat, or to be more precise, to over-eat. Let's say you go to the trendy burger diner with your friends on Saturday. Of course absolutely everyone and everything wants you to have a burger. And even if you were thinking: \"Oh I am going to have their Cobb salad\", the thought evaporates the minute you entered the joint and intoxicating smell of fresh French Fries started to claim your soul and stomach. Of course you will have the burger, fries, maybe even an appetizer and a beer. Simply because the place CONDITIONED you to do so. \nNow try to pull off the same at the bookstore caf\u00e9. First of all, no French Fries for obvious reasons ( fat stains on the pages?), second of all, portions are smaller and you will not order two turkey paninins under the poster of \"Farewell to Arms\". You would think: \" Hemingway wouldn't have done it. He fought the wars through the freezing German rain, he was lucky to have a stale slice of Russian bread.\" If Hemingway wouldn't touch you, Jane Austin will. \"Seriously, two paninis young lady? How on Earth will you fit into the dress you saw on sale at Macy's? Other more reasonable ladies who had one Panini will.\" \nEverywhere you look in the store, you stumble upon someone famous, skinny, spiritual or all of it. I am not even talking about entire diet aisle which is strategically located a floor above, not to ruin your skinny Panini. And food tastes amazingly fresh in there. Because you are not burdened with expectations of it to be great. \nYou don't dwell on your dining experience there. You devour your food in the corner and then wonder around pretending that you are above all of that, just like Gandhi, and you are so spiritually transparent because only good thoughts and water feed your soul. \nYou can call it pretentious, I call it smart. Have dinner there once a week and I can guarantee you will finally fit into the skinny jeans sold at Urban Outfitters next door.", "date": "2014-04-06 17:12:44}

I've even been drawing pictures of myself reading this novel in my Dram Bok.\n\nUpon entering Barnes and Noble I was taken aback by the amount of jabronis riffling through books like they're better than me. Ohhh, bet you read a lotta Gordon Wood, huh? You read your Gordon Wood and you regurgitate it from a textbook and you think you're wicked awesome doin' that, and how 'bout 'dem apples? And all that Gordon Wood business.\n\nBut that's not even the worst part. This Barnes and Noble has an in-store Starbucks. Do you know what coffee breath smells like? An old lady fart passing through an onion. Now, I didn't get a whiff of anyone's breath, but I can imagine.\n\nOn my way to the \"self help\" section I noticed a display of pens on the first floor, even though the \"self help\" section full of books is on the second floor. Yes, Barnes and Noble, put the books all the way upstairs, but leave the pens on the showroom floor. Oh, I get it. Cute. You leave this pen here and people are supposed to think, \"Wait, that looks like a dick.\"\n\nAnyways, I'll just regress, because I feel I made myself perfectly redundant. When I reached the aisle where my book was to be located it was not there. I almost fainted, I thought I browned out because I was drinking grain alcohol in the parking lot. I asked a store clerk where I could locate the book, but it was \"out of stock\". What good is a brick and mortar book store if they don't even have books. I shoulda popped my shirt off. Goddammit, really shoulda popped that shirt off. Maybe then the clerk would have shown me where the secret room full of books was.  Cause if the clerk said \"no,\" then the answer obviously is \"no.\" But the thing is, is she's not gonna say \"no.\" She would never say \"no,\" because of the implication.\n\nAnyhow, this place could be worse.

Do not use this company!  Our scheduled time for moving was on Friday at 9:00am.

I was called by Scott a local man who said that was wrong, the Florida people are only looking at a computer.  He assured me the movers would be there shortly.  I received another call around 11:00am or so stating that they were still at another job but were finishing up and would be on there way soon.  Around  noon the Florida person called my husband once again to assure him that the scheduled time of 1:00 was right on schedule.  The movers showed up at 4:30pm!  Then they told him that they would need to be there until 8:00pm or 8:30pm so would it be ok if they just came back on Saturday morning at 9:00am and they would get it all done.  They would bring back an extra guy and get it done fast!  Wallace called my husband and told him he would make things right and apologized for this mix up.  On Saturday, they were 50 minutes late, again.  Wallace showed up and spoke to my husband and told him he would give us the lowest rate and a 25% discount.  Whoopee!  After working for two hours, these guys went on a lunch break!  Really?  They did not get to our new apartment for two hours!  Our apartment is between 25-30 minutes away from our old house.  I called Scott to complain.  He was out of town and Wallace called me back to apologize and said he would come over to talk to me directly.  When the workers came, and I can't tell you their names because they never introduced themselves to me, we had to ask them to put something on the floor so they would not get the carpet all dirty.  ( I had called ahead to make sure they had something to protect the carpet as it is new or I would have provided something myself.)  After Wallace showed up, he took some notes, helped unload the truck, and then we talked about the price of the job.  We were quoted $325.00.  He wanted to give us a deal of $535.00!  He said that we had to understand \"that a quote is like throwing darts in the dark\".  Really?  The $535.00 was with a $65.00 discount.  He asked if we could meet somewhere in the middle.  My husband was much nicer than I was and said $400.00.  Wallace asked if we could do $425.00 so he didn't get hurt so bad, and I said I'd feel much better about $400.00.  He said that would be good.  I would have felt much better about 0-$200.00 after the stress filled two days I had with this company!   College Hunks says it provides a Stress Free Moving Experience.  IT DOES NOT!

We called Second Sole from the store and asked if they carried kids sizes. He assured us he had kids sizes in at least two or three brands of running shoes and would be happy to help fit our daughter. We promptly left Dick's and headed to Second Sole. WOW. The service we got at Second Sole was nothing short of impressive. This gentleman took time to try several different sizes on my daughter. He switched brands to see if another might fit even better and it did. We explained that she has fallen out of practice with tying shoes (thanks to velcro everything) and he suggested lock laces. We had no idea what those were until then. What a great idea for kids running shoes! He gave us 20% off the shoes and 10% off the laces just because -- no coupon. He took so much time with us -- we were thrilled. He really cared about being sure the shoes fit well and that she would not grow out of them too fast. I'm positive Dick's couldn't have possibly cared less about us or our daughter or anybody else's daughter/kid.

True the dishes are very Americanized and lack any type of complexity, but the vegetables and meat were very fresh and of good quality.  Any Chinese place that doesn't use sketchy chicken pieces in their dishes is all right with me!  The potstickers were homemade, according to my personal Asian food critic, and very tasty.  I enjoyed the eggroll, also homemade, and their spicy mustard was nasal-clearing good!  Of course the BF had to order the Mongolian beef.  The sauce didn't have the necessary sweetness to it, but he said it wasn't \"half bad\".

It's not overly garlic or overly buttery until you get to the last few bites. Think of it like ice cream, the last few bites are blanketed in sauce. \nThe house salad was a typical salad mix but their sweet and sour dressing was good. It wasn't rich or creamy like thousand island, but rather consistency of vinaigrette. It was light and sweet flavour like watered down honey mustard so was a great way to whet my appetite for the actual meal. \nOh. The bread. It comes w a light whipped butter. \nI love ice cream. Their ice cream pie dessert is great as well. The picture is of the chocolate, but I had both chocolate and coconut. I'd say the coconut is better (less of a fan of chocolate and cool whip and more of a coconut crumble). I don't know how exactly to describe it other than delicious. Think light ice cream pie w a crumbling crust. \n\nThe waitresses (Maureen) and owner (Beverly) were the epitome of midwestern hospitality. I came from out of state and stood out like a sore thumb. They were welcoming and you can have a decent genuine conversation. My second time back they remembered me and everything (a week and a half in between). Extremely friendly staff. \n\nThe place feels like home almost. Actually more like grandmas house for a thanksgiving dinner.

The hostess was so rude, abrupt and argumentative that we decided to leave.  \n\nWhile I understand that sometimes complications arise when a restaurant can no longer honor a gift certificate or discount, one would expect an apology or at least an explanation rather then rudeness and abuse.\n\nEDITED TO ADD:  The purchase date on this gift certificate was November 28, nearly one month *after* Asuka stopped honoring them.", "date": "2010-01-24 23:25:37}

When we arrived, we were incredibly hungry and wanted to grab a couple of beers and put a food order in as quickly as possible. When we snagged our server and got a couple of menus, we expected her to come back ready to take our orders. This was not so. We went to the bar and attempted to place them, where we were turned away because our server was heading our direction again. She completely overlooked us and we went on, hungry and parched, regretting not placing our order with force at the bar. \n\nAnyways, when the party quickly became bigger than projected, we were moved into the \"back\" where there was another bar and more seating for us. When we sat down, it seemed as though there were 2 different servers checking on us and buzzing around the area in confusion. I'm guessing it was because the girl that was serving the party on the other side wasn't going to continue to serve us on this side. So, we patiently waited for someone to take our orders and even mentioned to a couple of people a couple of times that we wanted to place an order with them. We got a few \"one sec\"s, which turned out to be a good 15 minutes. Eventually when the official bartender (I think he could be called the official one...) came, we placed an order at the bar. I do believe that this place is more efficient when it's a normal everyday crowd and not a larger than expected birthday party, or at least I want to believe it. \n\nI'd like to say all of the chaos was worth the delicious fish sandwich I had, but not quite. It was, in fact, one of the more impressive fish sandwiches I've had at a bar, but I was also famished and packing peanuts would have worked for me at that point. The fries were good, too. Pretty standard bar fries. But, the kicker for me was the cole slaw. I. Don't. Like. Cole. Slaw. I ate my little cup of coleslaw and loved it!

The next time I received a coupon in the mail, I looked for a bar code or number code, but there was nothing on the mailers for them to scan either.  So on a second occasion when I couldn't find a mailer, I printed a coupon from their site.  Again the woman refused and said the same nonsense about not being able to scan it.  When I mentioned that there was nothing on the mailers for her to scan either, she replied \"well that's what I've been told.\"  That was my last time using Pat's cleaners.  I use a different dry cleaner now, and I'm very happy with them.", "date": "2017-04-13 20:55:16}

I scoured hotels.com and found that this place was not only reasonably priced, but in a great location in regards to food, shopping, the expressway and downtown.  I booked my stay, and off I went.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was happy to get here.  The hotel isn't anything fancy. It's definitely clean and safe, but if you want a 5 star Hilton, keep driving.  I arrived at 12:30, and even though check in time is 2PM, the staff was nice enough to let me check in early!  I liked this because I've been to other hotels and they were much more rigid about check in time.  Plus, I was a bit tired from driving and really wanted to rest and relax.\n\nI also had requested a second floor room for security purposes, since I was traveling alone.  They accommodated this as well, which made me even happier.  I had the two queen beds reserved, and when I walked into the room, I was happy to see that it was in great shape!  They had a flatscreen TV with 42 channels, free WIFI with an awesome full signal, and a great little setup going on here with a desk area as well.\n\nBut, here's where I dock a star. I lumped it all together because I was really happy with the staff AND my stay here overall.  First, the room I booked was wonderful, but came without a coffee maker. I didn't realize this, and I guess for a few extra bucks a night I could have reserved a different room.  No, I can live with walking across the parking lot to get some coffee when needed, but coffee is kind of a big deal to me in the morning.  The girl at the desk said that normally they have a few extra machines to \"check out\" for people who want it, but they didn't have any available.  Boo.\n\nSecondly, the socket in the bathroom counter area must have reset itself because after I had taken a shower that night, I was unable to turn on my hairdryer.  I tried to reset it myself, but was unable to do so.  The next morning when I was on my way out, the nice maintenance man took care of it for me, so it did resolve itself.  Thirdly, the toilet did have to be manually reset because it was running after I had used it. It was only this one time my first night, and no I didn't complain about it because I fixed it myself!\n\nOn the bonus side, the desk is always staffed 24/7. I had great experiences here, and every morning they had out a baggie breakfast to people!  You get a bottle of water, a fresh apple, and your choice of muffins.  I went with the Chocolate muffin bag, so I really liked that!  Also, I received daily room service, so my beds were made, towels were restocked and everything was put back in order.\n\nI was very happy with my stay here.

The rolls are a bit more creative and tasty: you don't need Soy sauce for them TRY BEFORE YOU SATURATE IN SOY SAUCE.  Make sure to check out the volcano, tiger, victoria secret, and ima gastu (not sure of spelling on the last one).  They are a bit more pricer than other sushi places such as Sushi Rock, but the sushi is well worth it.  They also offer you more than other places: 8 big pieces from one of their rolls vs. 6 medium/small pieces from other places.  You can expect to be full with 2.5-3 rolls per a person.  On Mondays they offer 30% on sushi rolls!  On Mondays expect to spend roughly 25-30 per person depending on the gourmet rolls (the more gourmet and unique the higher)  and roughly 10-20 per person with the typical sushi rolls.

The service alone was above and beyond making sure I was comfortable,(above part) hand and arm massage while my hair was toned!!! It was purely amazing!. I felt pampered the moment I walked in and lasted the entire time I was there. The best part of all when it was all said and done...I fell in love with my hair again. Rachel and Ibi did wonders together and I couldn't be happier! If you are thinking about trying this salon, I said do it! You are not going to regret it, you will love that you made the choice.

They were still hot, which is much appreciated. Nothing is worse than cold eggs over easy.\n- Seasoned Potatoes: These were good. I usually like my breakfast potatoes on the more well done side. These were less crispy than I would have ideally liked, but they still had some crispy edges. So I enjoyed them.\n- Whole grain \"artisan\" toast: I laughed at the menu when it said \"artisan\" toast, being that this is a huge chain. But it really did not disappoint. The bread really elevated it from a normal, boring breakfast to a more delicious experience! Even if you don't like whole grain, I recommend this bread. Tasty. \n- Fruit: This is not part of \"The Traditional\", which normally comes with some type of meat. Our waitress was great and when I said \"no meat\", she offered this up instead. It was some melon, watermelon and pineapple. All fresh cut. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience! I don't drink coffee or anything like that, so I think my meal was 8-10$. Not that bad for a breakfast.\n\nI will definitely return! There's nothing super unique about it but it was clean, bright, and the food was solid!

From the get-go I was underwhelmed.  While the receptionist was polite enough, she put out a very condescending vibe.  My pedicurist came out and greeted me and was much friendlier than the receptionist.  Before I continue, let me qualify what I'm about to say with the fact that I am a licensed salon professional myself, trained in an Aveda school, so I know what to look for and how to do her job.  That being said, the pedicure itself was pretty terrible.  She did not file my feet properly, I had to redo it when I got home.  She didn't take off all of my existing polish well enough.  She didn't push or nip my cuticles.  She didn't really massage my feet or legs.  And I had three nails lose their polish in less than 3 days, which I assume is because she didn't properly prep the nail before applying the polish.  She also finished in 50 minutes, which is less time than the pedicure below the spa pedi.\n\nAll in all, I would not go back to this place.  I didn't even call and complain because I didn't want to be offered another pedicure as reparation.  I would have given them fewer stars, but my pedicurist was nice and polite and I liked her.  She's just very new, not confident enough yet, and needs to be more mindful of the steps she skips because when someone pays $60 for a spa service, they expect to have an amazing experience.", "date": "2015-03-28 00:27:29}

He was great.  My issue is I look up what I want to eat on-line at restaurant websites as I usually forget to bring reading glasses.  Today I ordered the Belgian waffle with fruit compote which, on the website, looked at least 1\" high with a bowl of compote as big as a soup bowl (not that I would have eaten or wanted that much but they were also fresh berries shown on the website and the compote i was served had 2 small unknown variety berries in a dark syrup).  In reality the waffle is 1/2\" high and the compote comes in a tiny tin with maybe 1 tblsp of compote.  I even asked the waiter where the compote was as I thought the tiny serving was maple syrup.  Another issue is the same for both breakfasts I had - both  were barely more than warm.  You have to eat fast if you don't want to eat cold food.\nThe final issue is the table in front of me was being bussed and the diners had not used either the coffee cups or water glasses left on the table.  The cleaner moved the glass/coffee cups with her bare fingers by sticking her fingers inside the items to move them to the back of the table to be used by the next diner who sat there.  I really believe that is a sanitation faux pas and if the next diner knew someones fingers had been inside their drink cups they probably would not have liked it.  Maybe some additional training is required.  I don't believe the busser even thought about what she was doing could be potentially wrong.", "date": "2016-05-27 19:15:36}

The servers are friendly and dedicated as well, and many of us know each other on a first name basis.  The decor is akin to a nice family restaurant or higher end diner, with tables and booths.  I love the ample parking in the nearby garage and/or parking lot too.  'FirstWatch' is a welcome joy to my selection of the most favorite places to go to for a good, satisfying breakfast!  \n\nUPDATE July 2014:  I have to reduce my previous 5-star rating to 3 stars!  Don't EVER go there on a Sunday morning, unless you enjoy waiting half an hour to an hour to get served!  We (party of 2) waited for 45 minutes, then sat down and waited another 15 minutes for our food!  A grand total of ONE HOUR between the time we walked in, and the time we got our breakfast!  NO breakfast is worth a 1 hour wait, especially with an 8 year old hungry kid in tow!  And to make matters worse, the place is packed with selfish, egotistical local SNOBS who take their sweet time eating, then hanging out as if at a cafe, instead of finishing their meals at a normal pace, then leaving to make room for others!\n\nSo, to sum things up, it's OK to go there on weekdays, but on Sunday mornings... FUHGEDDABOUDIT!\n\nUPDATE October 2015:  They have a newer, more updated and 'upscale' menu now (don't like it as much), and they no longer put a jelly carousel on the table.  I liked the old First Watch a LOT better, since I had a choice of several jellies at my disposal.  Now I have to ask to see if they have the various flavors I like (and that they had).  I asked for grape, and they only had 'sugar-free' grape, which I will not imbibe because it tastes terrible and has artificial sweeteners.  Lastly, their pumpkin pancakes taste a bit 'off' (IHOP blows them away), and the prices have gone UP!  Are they trying to cater to only upper middle class Westlake now?

I chose a lower budget place to stay in order to be able to do more things with my family.  My motto for the week was \"it's just a place to sleep\".  The bed was so hard that we had to buy a mattress topper on our second day.  Thankfully, that made a difference.\n\nWe asked for our room to only be serviced once during the week.  We wanted to be able to take items out of the room.  We chose Wednesday because that was the middle of our stay and we were going to do laundry.  We pulled the sheets off of the bed and piled our towels on the floor for easy clean up.  When we returned that evening, we found our dirty towels still in the pile, the same sheets were put back on the bed and it was poorly made.  I called down to the desk to address the issues and was told they would do full service the following day.  I declined and asked for clean sheets to change the bed myself.\n\nOn Thursday, we returned to our room to discover that they came to \"clean\" the room again despite only asking for service once during the week.  Once again, the sheets were not changed, the towels were stIll in the pile, and the sheets were twisted under the comforter.  On top of that, the towel that is used as a rug in the bathroom was removed and a new one was not left.  The toilet was not cleaned either.\n\nThe evening before our departure, we packed what we could and checked the room, including under the beds.  I am glad I did not look there at the beginning because there was a toy, socks, and beef jerky left under there from previous guests.  We should have known that there would be something under there because we found the room to be what we thought was slightly dirty upon our arrival.  We bought disinfecting wipes to clean these issues.\n\nOn to the positive.  The motel was located very near the interstate.  It would have been nice to be able to turn left off of the street but I could usually make a quick u-turn.

The staff seems pleasant and the place is big, with lots of room to stretch out and breathe.  \n\nTHE DOWN-SIDE:  Ok, I'm biased.

I'm not a dumb man, but I found the process of comparing the list with every item to be monotonous and confusing.  And, while this place is big on breakfast, they do NOT offer gluten-free bread.  So, cut out french toast, toast, and all the sandwiches that you might order.  This isn't a gluten-free menu - it's a lame attempt to say, \"Hey!  You can eat gluten-free here, if you're willing to do all the work to figure it out and have almost no choices!\"\n\nUltimately, I went with sausage, an OJ, and a fruit parfait.

All of the other things like being a local place and using local ingredients go out the window.  The quality of the ice cream wins out over everything else.\n\n$100 in gas and about $10 in tolls.

The waiting area had plenty of room with benches and had some comfortable lounge chairs. They had complimentary coffee available, which adds a nice touch.  By the time we left around 10:30am the wait was probably closer to 30-45 mins. \nI would highly recommend downloading the NoWait app and check-in before you get there. There were people who got seated before us and showed up after us that used that app to check-in. \n\nService: No complaints about the staff. Didn't bother you but made sure you were happy. The food wait time was average for a breakfast/ lunch joint (5-10 mins after ordering) \n\nFood and Beverage: The coffee was average at best, but the food made up for the sub par coffee. I got the Breakfast Scrambler which was excellent. The one thing I noticed about this place compared to other breakfast places is that everything seemed a little extra healthy. The eggs and potatoes were not dripping in butter and oil. There was fruit cup as a side with just about everything. Even the ketchup they served was non- high fructose corn syrup. \n\nPortion Size: I have no complaints about the portion sizes because I was full when I left and ate everything. As a comparison to other diners and restaurants, the portion size is far below average; but who eats left over breakfast food...\n\nPrice: 2 people is probably going to almost always be around $25; food, drink and tip. Things are slightly on the higher end for breakfast food but I would say that the quality of the food I worth the slightly inflated price. \n\nAccessibility: This First Watch is in Crocker Park so you will have to park in a parking garage and walk some. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready so you can stroll around Crocker if the wait is long (which it almost always is during the weekend). Like I mentioned before, get the NoWait app and check-in through that and save lots of time. \n\nCleanliness: Our table was clean and not sticky. We did not smell like we just walked out of a diner when we left. Overall a well kept restaurant. \n\nSummary: High quality food, good service, below average parking accessibility, and reasonably priced for the quality of food. \n\nI recommend this restaurant to you and I will be going again.", "date": "2015-12-18 17:08:10}

We usually go to a couple of other Chinese restaurants, but I wanted him to try Asian Wok. He was impressed! Yes, they have boxes piled up in the bar area and trinkets all around. It's a good \"dive\" feel. We were met with smiles and kindness. The food was delicious; he had the beef and broccoli. We also had fried rice; which he says usually needs to be doused in soy, but not here; perfectly seasoned. \nThis was a wonderful Christmas meal and we will definitely be back, throughout the year!!", "date": "2017-12-26 00:54:52}

From the bite of the first sample it was obvious that everything was homemade. My only complaint is that there were so many flavors to choose from it made it nearly impossible to decide. I ended up trying the smallest portion of three (only the portions aren't all that small). First off was something unusual, which I choose the Strawberry Jalape\u00f1o. It was fresh with a real bite for a finish. Next up was the Salted Caramel, if you're a lover of caramel and salt this is the ticket! Last was one of my personal favorite pistachio...well, Toasted Pistachio. That was awesome. I really don't need to say anything about the quality of the ice cream or even the flavors other than OUTSTANDING! This is a truly a must stop. In regards to the rest of the review...\n\nCleanliness: Excellent! The seating in an outdoors was very well kept. The floors and tables were all clean and despite having an abundance of children with dripping ice cream free from stickiness. The bathrooms were great and the prep area for everyones ice cream order was cleaned immediately.\n\nService: Excellent: Service with a smile despite giving out a number of sample tastings.\n\nSeating: Outstanding: Seating was abundant both inside and out. The outdoor area was all covered but allowed for ability to enjoy the summer warmth.\n\nOverall: This is easily a 5 Star ice cream shop in my book. I just wished they were  in my state and town. Great job Mitchell's and I hope to visit you again one day.", "date": "2014-08-05 11:20:51}
