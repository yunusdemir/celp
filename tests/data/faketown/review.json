The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!\n\nThis particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.\n\nThe seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.\n\nSometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.\n\nI'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.","date": "2011-10-27 13:11:48"}

I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails.","date": "2014-04-19 17:14:38"}

After a few days I decided to call back just to make sure that they weren't waiting on anything else from me and Jeff answered the phone and told me someone would call me back in 5 minutes.

Again I got Jeff and he was extremely rude and said he couldn't take my call right then because other calls were ahead of me (even though I was still waiting for his call back from 5 days previously!). He said he would call back in 15 minutes-no call. Then the manager Cathy called and explained she had been out of town for a week and apologized and said that she would get back to me later in the day. I left two more messaged that afternoon and of course no response. Called again this morning and same response. I would have given up long ago if they didn't have my cc info. I have just e-mailed them to cancel everything and hope that they will actually follow through with this request.\nBottom line is that everyone makes mistakes and I am more than willing to work with someone in that situation but Allyson's Flowers has not made one effort to get to the bottom of this fiasco.

I did exactly that and agreed to the $13 delivery charge. \n\nI get a call about an hour later from a fast-talking scam artist saying they had just moved their location and \"Jeff\" is on his way to the office to figure out what's going on but the driver needs an additional $15 to complete the delivery because the address is farther out than they expected (30 MILES!!!) Uhhhhh NO! How is the location 30 miles away from you when you are listed as local and when I called, there was no mention of an ADDITIONAL delivery fee. I said no way, cancel the order and asked for a refund. I'll give them one business day to give me the refund before I dispute the charge.\n\nThey are obviously not local, just posing as such. DO NOT ORDER from these people. Ugh!", "date": "2017-11-27 20:51:03"}

By dealings with Allyson's Florist absolutely warranted a post on Yelp of a bad review.  My Mom passed away in Seattle, WA.  I live in San Diego, CA and looked up flowers near where my Mom's service would be and Allyson's Florist came up online.  I ordered flowers to be delivered to the Burial site on one day and additional flowers to be delivered to the church on a different date for the Memorial Ceremony.  \n\nThe day of the Burial I received a phone call from the funeral home telling me they hadn't received the flowers for the Burial Ceremony.  I called Allyson's Flowers and they said they didn't have an event to deliver flowers that day but only for the day of the Memorial.  They said they called the funeral home and the funeral home told them there were no events that day.  I of course asked Allyson's Floral why they didn't call the customer (me) to confirm and they just proceeded to blame the funeral home.  The burial and the memorial service date/time/location were both on the funeral's website and the funeral home said all of their employee's have access to the calendar.  So 45 min before the Burial Ceremony I had no flower arrangement for the casket and all Allyson's Florist did for their snafu was say, \"I'm sorry.\"  \n\n\"I'm sorry\" does not cut it 45 minutes before the ceremony.  I asked to talk to the manager and they said he (Jeff) was out of town on vacation.  I asked if they could at least waive the delivery fee for this huge snafu and they said they would give me $10.00 off a $600.00 bill, really??  That was all you could do?  \n\nI went to QFC and their florist saved the day.  She made me a beautiful arrangement in less than 30 minutes so I wanted to give a shout out to the local QFC grocery store/florist department for coming through on a very emotional and now flower snafu day.  Thank you QFC!\n\nThe other flowers from Allyson's Floral were delivered to the Memorial on the correct date and location; however, one of the bouquets were wrong.  I called the manager (Jeff) the following week and he told me he was not the manager.  Really?  He said Anna was the manager and she would call me back.  I spoke to Anna and she said she wasn't the manager but the manager did approve the $10.00 discount and she was \"sorry\" for the miscommunication. I gave up at that point to find out who actually is the manager.  Clearly the workers don't know or are hiding this issue from the manager.   \n\nUnbelievable, you do not screw up flowers for weddings and funerals and then have NO customer service and NOT own your mistake and NOT make it right with the customer!!

Discover the Wonders of INNER Space\n\nLike walking through the pages of an exclusive high-end home interiors publication, expect to begin making a list of must-haves soon after arriving.  If you've never visited any of the Arhaus furniture stores, you're missing out on an impressive selection of upholstered and wood pieces, lighting, and many unique accessories.  One beautiful example after another.  At the Crocker Park location, I found at least 10 things I HAD to have. Fortunately, I don't really need them !---but I can't get a gorgeous computer desk/wall unit out of my mind---especially at the substantially reduced sale price. \n\nIt's not inexpensive by most furniture standards, but worth stopping in even if you're closely budgeting right now.  If you like, you can very easily take a look at what's being offered by just pulling up their web site for a stunning preview.   http://www.arhaus.com/   You'll be widening your perspective in a very good way.   After some diligent planning and saving, you might soon be custom-ordering the perfect color in the perfect fabric for that perfect sofa---the very one you fell in love with just a few months before.\n\n***  Watch for advertised store-wide ARHAUS sales.  \n       There may also be unadvertised price reductions on \n       limited items in each store.  Call each location for any \n       special sale-priced pieces.    \n \n***  The least expensive furnishings can sometimes end \n       up being the most expensive over time if you're \n       replacing the same item every few years.   Choosing \n       one of better quality materials and construction is well\n       worth considering.    Arhaus ranges from $$ (sale and \n       some accessories) to $$$$.\n\n***  If contemplating the purchase of any upholstered item \n       from a catalogue or internet source ---whether lower-\n       end or higher-end---you won't be able to test for \n       springs, and seat, back, and arm padding.  Rather \n       than crossing your fingers and hoping it will be \n       comfortable, trying out the real thing is always better \n       and smarter.    \n\n\nIf I sound partial to Arhaus, it's because I worked here (another location) many moons ago.  I found a few of the same beautiful classic favorites, plus lots of new and fabulous additions.    Stop in and see for yourself !", "date": "2012-04-06 05:12:30"}

I asked where he was and he mentioned Westlake...I said \"Washington.\"  He said 'Yes,' I then questioned my order - no order number had been provided (my bad!) and I had 'questimated' the charges based on my order.  Lo and Behold it was more than I thought.  I was told I ordered a higher cost basket and that was why my amount was more.  I gently explained that NO - I was reading right off the website and the one I ordered was not the one that was charge.  Long, long story - I was told by Jeff that my CC would be credited with the additional amount.  So I will wait and see.....if not I will call back.  My aggravation was that he indicated he was in the area I wanted, when in reality they are located in Westlake, OH - 2500\u00b1 from where I wanted the flowers to go.  I incurred the cost of $17.95 for 'delivery' fee.  Lesson for me and everyone - really, really, really look at the name of the place and make sure they are where they say they are.

But the bottle list look to be pretty long so they have a lot of beer options. They also have liquor and I believe they have wine. \n\nI guess what they're known for here would be the pizza. All of their pizza here is thin crust which I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza. I got \"The Breakaway\" which is garlic, mushrooms, and a couple different kinds of cheese. I liked it and it was actually very well-made but it was missing something for me based on my personal preference of pizza I definitely would like to go back and try it again and maybe request some basil on top I think it would add a good bit of extra flavor. They have a lot of different pizzas that I would like to go back and try.

I had been to Aladdin's and Mezza (just a few miles west of The Fountain) before, so I was quite familiar with most of the food. We were the only table there that night for dinner, so service was spot on.  Unfortunately, they don't have a liquor license...boooo.  I ordered a Turkish coffee.  It was pretty strong...similar to espresso.  \n\nWe started off by ordering a bunch of appetizers for everyone to share.  They have a combo deal where you can choose 4 cold appetizers or 3 hot appetizers for $15.  We had hummus, baba ghanoush, Mahamarra, and tabbouleh, all of which came with pita triangles for dipping, falafel, kibbeh, Fatayer pies, and Barak (Obama) Rolls.  I honestly really liked them all!  The Mahamarra had a nice bit of spice to it, but nothing overwhelming.  \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Fountain Mixed Grille - a nice combo plate of Shish Tawook, Chicken Shawarma, beef kabob, and veggies with a side of rice pilaf or bulgur.  It took a little while for the food to come out because they make everything fresh to order, but it was so worth the wait!  This was one big plate of meat!  Everything was juicy, nicely seasoned and cooked just right. (see uploaded photo)  I can't believe I managed to eat it all!  It was so good and I was pretty full so, I didn't have room for dessert.  The owner came out to describe the dessert options available. A number of the girls ordered dessert and they all seemed to like it!  (Check the photos) Maybe next time, I'll order a smaller entree, so I'll have room for dessert. \n\nAfter we were finished, the owner came to thank us for coming in for dinner and the Turkish chef even came out to say hi.  Everyone was very friendly and appreciative of our business.\n\nIt was a great evening of great food and friendly people.  I'll definitely be back!", "date": "2015-04-26 06:38:39"}

My wife had there French onion soup and I had a walleye sandwich. I'm house made chips made even better with being served with French onion dip.", "date": "2017-06-06 03:42:45"}

I really do save those for the BEST of the BEST, in my opinion anyways.  I can't believe no one has reviewed my fantabulous wedding photographer yet, so here you go.\n\nWe hired Making the Moment for our wedding on April 9, 2011.  Our initial meeting was with Brett, the owner.  He answered all our questions and was incredibly friendly & helpful.  We looked through all the photographer's portfolios and decided we liked Vince's style the most.\n\nOur wedding was slightly offbeat...we were married in a theater and had a movie theme, because we are big time movie nerds.  Vince totally embraced this, even staying up late the night before the wedding to watch Pulp Fiction (which he knew was our favorite film and would be referenced many times that day).  I have nothing but positive things to say about our day with him, our own private paparazzi!  He was enthusiastic, artistic, and helpful.  The ceremony music started way before I was ready and I had both my maid of honor and Vince lying on the floor, buckling my shoes for me.  Now THAT is a selfless photographer!  \n\nWe were like kids waiting for Christmas as we waited for our photo preview several weeks later.  It was, of course, worth the wait.  We had a \"premiere night\" with owner Brett at Making the Moment HQ (aka Brett's house).  He set out wine and fancy snacks for us as we viewed our photos.  His excitement about our images matched our own, and we were all pretty giddy as we watched the slide show.\n\nOverall, this is some of the best customer service I've ever received ANYWHERE.  If I can give any brides and/or grooms-to-be advice, it's to splurge on your photos, and hire a photographer that shares your vision.  If you're in Northeast Ohio, hire Making the Moment.  You will not regret it.  I certainly don't hope to get married again any time soon, but I do hope to get the chance to work with them again!", "date": "2012-02-22 02:25:55"}

Given that I travel 40 weeks a year and had a trip the following week, I did not leave my case for fear the part would not arrive in time. I crossed my fingers that the zipper would hold out until the part came in and my schedule would allow for the repair. They called me that the parts arrived just a few days later! They were so kind and gracious to allow me to drop off my Luggage with a promise it would be done in time for my next trip. They were true to their word! Perfect Repair and Done When Promised!

At the salon i noticed she cut off at least an inch more than i asked, but i didn't say anything because i figured it wasn't worth it and its not like she could take it back. It wasn't until i got home that my roommate asked why my hair is so uneven. I looked in the mirror and the left side of my bangs were at least an inch shorter than the right side!! Huge difference! And its not like my hair was parted a different way while cutting. I asked for it to be parted down the center and cut like that because that's how i wear it. So now my left side starts an inch ABOVE my chin, and my right side starts at my chin! I look absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe i didn't inspect her cut more after she did it. So now i have to wear ponytails until my hair is long enough to be fixed. I am seriously sick to my stomach over this. I will never be back nor recommend your salon.", "date": "2015-08-17 14:49:52"}

I'm not sure why restaurants in Cleveland think people want to eat a mix of iceberg and romain hearts.  I would have preferred a nice spring mix or spinach salad which would have complimented the tuna much better. Ordered the tuna medium rare and it came out medium.  The seasoning on the tuna was so salty it completely ruined the dish.
