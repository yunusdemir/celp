  "text": "I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!\n\nThis particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.\n\nThe seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.\n\nSometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.\n\nI'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.",

  "text": "My experience today compelled me to write a review. I've been coming here very regularly and have raved to others about their long-lasting shellac.  Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service. I know you can do better Tina's nails.",

I went back again after another two days.  The manage was there and couldn't be bothered to come out from behind the desk to look at my skin.  She was not helpful and her resolution was to offer me a complimentary service.  Really?  I don't want to go back to have your team mess up my face.  She comment to me \"I am not a doctor.  I can't give you medical advice.\"  How does a business that offers skin care services not have a protocol in place to handle adverse reactions?  I am not upset at the welts the product caused on my face, I am upset that they didn't seem to care or have any remedies.  Surely, I am not the first person to react to the wax in this way.  Completely unprofessional mgmt experience.  Stay away!",

There's a system that is exactly the same at each yogurt store and no one differentiates from it.  Because it works.  Customers get their cup, pick their yogurt, scoop on their own toppings and pay per weight.  Usually you can get a decent sized cup with more than enough toppings for about 3-4 bucks.  \nI don't think I've walked out of Spoon Me spending less than 5 bucks after all was said and done.  Unless I want a small yogurt with no toppings.  Everything is ala carte.  Toppings..extra.
